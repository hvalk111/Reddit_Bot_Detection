"First, stop hanging around your family. If your mom is being secretive, that's her problem. 

Second, talk to your brother about it, and try to get him to share with you the ways in which he knows that your dad is a drug addict. 

Third, get your mom to let you know anything that she doesn't want to share with you. If she is being secretive, you can ask her why. 

If all else fails, then see a therapist.",0
">My mom is very closed-off and doesn't really listen to others and doesn't really trust them. She doesn't really like any of my family members very much. I don't understand why my family is so secretive about important things, like my dad's addiction, or my brother's involvement in drugs.

That's okay, your dad still loves and cares about you. You need to just make sure you are okay with that, because it's not like she doesn't care. She's doing you a favor by keeping you safe from their harmful behaviors.

If you don't trust your mother to be an ally in this, maybe you should break the news to her, but you should also make sure you *do* trust her.

> I don't know how to tell him about it. I am just so upset with her and don't know how to confront her about it. I don't want to have a confrontation with my mom because I know that she won't listen to me and that she will just be upset with me if I tell her. How do I bring it up to my mom about this? If my family is so secretive about important things, I don't see how it is that our relationship will last. I don't know what to even consider this relationship, it's really messed up.

If you want to bring up the fact that you feel disrespected by your mom, you can bring it up with her, but you also need to make sure you're okay with that.

She could be doing you a favor by keeping you safe from their harmful behaviors. She could be doing it to help you. That doesn't mean you have to take her word for it, but you should talk to her if you want to try to repair that relationship, because it sounds like she may be doing you a favor. It's okay to be upset, but you shouldn't be over-reacting to it.",0
"My mom is the same way. I'd have a hard time getting over it if it were me. I've been in a similar relationship but not with her. Honestly, I just want to be on better terms with my family. 

I'm sorry for your family's behavior, I can only imagine how difficult it must be.",0
Have you tried talking to her at all?  I know it's hard to do that but it's better than nothing.,0
Just tell it to your brother. I bet he has no problem telling your mom the same thing.,0
Just ask her how old the daughter is. Then tell her she is being an asshole because she's trying to ruin your relationship with your dad.,0
"This is weird. My parents are very closed off.  My dad doesn't really listen to me or my brother when we talk about important things because he does not trust us. If I tell them things, it's to show him to understand, not to get my brother involved. The reason we don't listen is because they only listen to one side of the story. If it happened the other way, they would listen.  I'm sorry for your situation.",0
"It started with a video on Youtube about a black guy getting attacked and it really went viral.

The issue is that it was edited and the black guy in the video is not really black, it is actually a white rapper who had a whole lot of problems in the past and has some racist views, which were a big part of the problem with the incident.

The real life event happened but it was edited to make it look like the guy was white.",0
"I think it's just the internet being what it is, and it has been running for a few years.  It seems to have really picked up steam in 2014 and is picking up steam again right now, along with some other groups.  I think we are at the very beginning of it.",0
"This is a very complicated topic, so I'll just give your most basic answer.  The short of it is, there is a group of people who want to change how police act and interact with the public.  The issue with this is that they aren't actually changing anything, they are trying to change the police into something they want them to be.  The police are in no way obligated to take any particular action.  The police are not forced to act in any particular way.  The police can make any decision they want.  The problem is that the police feel that they are being attacked by these protests and the people who are protesting them.  These people, who are not the police, are trying to change their own behavior and the police's behavior.  At its heart, the goal is to force police to do their job.

As to why the issues are so much more prominent on Reddit than they are in real life, I can only speculate, but I think it has something to do with the fact that most people who are protesting these actions are black.  

As for why these are so many posts on reddit, I can only speculate.",0
"The short version is: there's a lot of people who are upset over the deaths of police officers. A lot of people think that police officers are unfairly targeted by those who don't agree with their actions. So now you have a bunch of people who are angry at police and using that to their advantage. There's a bunch of people who think the Black Lives Matter movement is wrong and want to distance themselves from it, but not all of them are the same.",0
"In the United States it's a relatively new movement, started by Black Lives Matter. It was started by the Black Lives Matter chapter in Phoenix, Arizona, after a white police officer shot an unarmed black man during a traffic stop. 

The movement began as a response to a spate of police shootings of black people in recent years.

The movement was initially focused on police brutality; police killing of black people as a means of controlling local unrest. Now, the movement is being viewed as a direct response to the police killings of black people.",0
"It's being used as a catch all for the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as a way to point out racial injustices. 

The only posts I can find on Reddit are about how this particular movement is being used as a rallying cry for racism (as opposed to something that is actually being used)",0
"It's the latest in a series of social media campaigns by people to push their viewpoint by demanding that others follow their example.

So, if someone says they are anti-police, then it's easy to ask ""well, what is stopping you from being an anti-police?  How is this going to make your life better?""

And then everyone has to do the same.

This can lead to some very bizarre situations where people are asking ""well, what is stopping you from being a pro-police?""

And so on and so forth until the general public asks ""well, what is stopping you from being a pro-police?""  

And so on until the media asks ""well, what is stopping you from being a pro-police?""

And so on and so forth.",0

"I think that Tarantino is absolutely right. Not only do I think music is used in a lot of Tarantino's films, but I think the use of music is integral to the theme of the film. I think that Tarantino is a great example of how to use music well within the film. He uses music in a way that I think is very organic, and very subtle. And as a bonus, the music is used in a way that is not as ""overused and overhyped"" as some of the more popular film scores. While it is true that Tarantino is probably the biggest critic of film scores, his use of them is not at all a bad thing.

I would also like to mention that I would actually recommend his most recent film, Jackie Brown. It is based on the novel of the same name, and has a score that is a lot more in line with his style. He doesn't have as many great songs as he does, and it is a bit more formulaic, but it is still a great film to watch.

I would also like to mention that I would also like to recommend Inglorious Basterds, which has a score that is very similar to his style. (The music also does a great job of complementing the violence which is pretty intense.) If you haven't seen it, it is absolutely worth your time.

As for the soundtrack, I'd like to recommend Django Unchained. I think it is probably the most ""modern"" score that Tarantino has ever done. It is much more ""in your face"" than anything other than Pulp Fiction, and it fits the tone of the film very well.",0
"I will definitely have to check out the soundtrack, thanks for the link. I have seen some of the ""Basterds"" music, but I think it's more of a movie rather than a soundtrack, but I will keep it in mind for next time I watch it. 

I haven't heard of the score for The Hateful Eight, but I don't need a recommendation to go watch it because it's easily on par with other great film scores, and the music is one of the aspects of the movie that I love.

[Here's a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_mq5vq-ZMg)",0
"I always kind of assumed he just kind of used music as a crutch, you know, in lieu of dialogue, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lH2_J-cIk) guy. I remember reading reviews for *Django* where there was this guy who basically said that the movie was so lacking in music it was almost a chore to watch. I suppose it's interesting to me that he didn't like the music, and he doesn't seem to be the only one who disliked the music.

I'm not saying his is the only example of this in cinema, but it can certainly be a common theme in Tarantino films.",0
"I think music is one of the most important elements in Tarantino's films. In Inglorious Basterds, I'm not really sure if the music is part of the scene itself, it's more like a secondary thing, but I think the use of music is really great. The use of music is really what makes the film, I think. I think it was a really well directed film, but I also think it could have been better if there were less music. But it is still a good film.",0
"Tarantino is the one I think that is the best in all of cinema when it comes to music. I think that he's amazing in his ability to make the scenes you're watching even more tense and to make the atmosphere more intense. I think that this is why I like his films more and more.

I don't think I've seen an instance of him using music that I would consider bad. His use of music in his films is great.",0
"I think that music is used to heighten the tension in Tarantino's films. A good example would be in Inglorious Basterds. In the scene where we see the gang in the hotel, John Cusack is at the piano and is singing to calm them down. The song is ""Basterds"" which is a very intense scene. The use of music to accentuate what would otherwise be a very intense scene is a real artform in Tarantino's films.

I think the use of music in his films is important in conveying the theme of tension and being unsettled. I think it really works in a lot of his films, and I think it's an effective use of music. I'd love to hear what you guys think!

Also, I'm planning to watch the soundtrack of The Hateful Eight, I'm interested in hearing what you guys think of it.

EDIT: I've also been looking at film scores to see if any of them are similar to the ones used in the films. I've been trying to find the score of The Hateful Eight, but I've been unsuccessful. Any recommendations?",0

When he left, I was so happy that I couldn't stop crying and crying. I just wanted to talk to him. I wanted to chat. I asked him if he was okay. He said he was just taking a nap. He didn't wanna talk, I said, and he said he would be later. I know it was kind of silly because I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks, but I was just so happy that he was okay, and I felt so bad that he was missing me. I knew he was going to be alright. I told my friend what I did last night, and she said I was being ridiculous. My friend said that I was being too needy.

"You need to figure out if you want your child to be a part of this marriage or not. If you want her to be a part of it maybe get on her best behavior and see if she's interested in taking a pregnancy test to the clinic to make sure. If you want her to not be involved in this then maybe just figure out how you will handle the baby once it's born. I think that you would want to take care of your daughter and make sure that she knows you're a good father and that daddy has her back.

Just remember that you can't control other people. You would want your child to be there for you no matter what. If your girlfriend is willing to go to the clinic then maybe you should also go to the clinic just in case. If you have a choice about your baby then I think that you should take it.

What is your relationship with her? Do you want to marry her?,0
Get a paternity test. That could come in handy.,0
"I think you need to do the following: 

1) Tell her that you are not ready to marry her yet. 

2) Ask her to go ahead and do the paternit y test anyway. If she gets the result she will know that you want to marry her and that you want to be with her. 

3) Make an effort to contact her every day and tell her that you miss her  and all your family. That you miss her friends. Make sure she knows that you miss her and that you miss family. 

4) Ask her if you can see the child. When you meet her let her know that you are not prepared to marry her yet and that you want to see the child. That you hope that there is still a chance of a happy future. 

5) If she is still not ready to marry her then you need to decide if you want to try to get a lawyer and get a custody arrangement that you feel is best for your daughter. If that is not possible then you will need to move on. 

She will understand if you break up because she will realize that you are not ready to marry her. But as she is pregnant it will be really hard to leave her.

"You're really just in the same place you were before you found out. You've been with her for 7 years, you've seen the baby, and you still feel the same way of love for her. You're looking for a way to do something you feel you should be doing, but just aren't. You just want to do something that you know you should do, but you're unsure of how to do it.

She's going to need some support throughout this process. You shouldn't feel bad for asking her for support on this. But also, you need to make sure that you're in a good place mentally. If you're feeling low, you need to make sure it's not because of any external thing. It's entirely possible that the pregnancy has taken a toll on your mental health, and that being in a situation where you're thinking about the child and the new parents can help you to feel better.

Also, I really don't know what your age is, but I think it's important to remember that this is something that your wife and you both decided together. A child is different from a pregnancy. Just because you found out before the pregnancy doesn't mean you're wrong. She's not wrong for having an abortion, and you're not wrong for wanting it. She's also not wrong for not wanting to keep the baby and raising it. They're different things.

Also, it really doesn't matter if it's a girl or a boy. You need to do this for yourself, and for her. If you do it for either, you're making yourself a part of the wrong, and that's just not what either of you want.

If you're married, ask her to call a friend to come over and help you with the baby. It'll help you both be emotionally available when you need it, and will also help her get a fresh perspective.

It's okay if you have to be more of a leader on this. The only thing that's really stopping you from doing it now is your worries, and you're worried about that. If you think you can do it, and she thinks you can do it, go for it.

That said, I'm sure she's feeling even worse than you are now. If there's one thing you can do, it's to make sure you're being as supportive as you can.",0

"Yes. All of our actions are eternal in the eyes of God. We are saved by faith in Christ alone. We are saved by Christ's death on the cross, and our resurrection.

The Bible also says that each of us will die and go to heaven or hell depending on our faith and our willingness to keep God's commandments, which includes believing that Jesus died on the cross and rose again.",0
"I think that if your soul was sent to hell, you would be in a lot better off.

If you are in the body of a human, you are in a body that is inherently sinful. You are subject to death from a very early age, and to sin means to disobey God. This sin is passed on to the children of men, who will be subject to death. This is the problem with an afterlife. We are condemned to a place where we are judged for eternity based on the sins we committed when we were alive. 

It's not a good way to go. And it doesn't make sense.",0
"I believe that a human body gets recycled, but not in the same way that plants get recycled. For example, if I dig a hole in the ground and bury my garden, then the garden will get recycled. On the other hand, a human body gets recycled only if the body can be recycled and is somehow preserved and brought back into the living world. And that's where my understanding of ""hell"" comes from.

And this is just my opinion, but I believe that it's possible for God to keep his promises, and that he will keep his promises to his children forever. But he also has a limited amount of time to accomplish what he has promised. Just as he promises to send each of us a soul upon our death, there's a ""limit"" amount of time for each of us.

I don't believe in predestination, but I do believe that God is sovereign over who He chooses to bring a soul to the living world, and that each person has a ""time limit"" where it is their choice to either accept God, or reject God. For example, I believe that if you are a Christian, then you get to choose to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior. And if you reject Jesus, then you get to pay the consequences of your decision. Also, if you do accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, then you get to go to heaven.

I don't think that God is going to keep his promises forever. He's going to keep his promises to the children of Adam. I think that the life of man will be a very short life, compared to what God has promised for us.",0
"The soul and the body are two different things. There is a difference between the soul and the body and death.

"I think the assumption that when we die our bodies are dissolved and our souls are sent to ""hell"" is based off of a common human way of thinking.  Our bodies dissolve when we die, so we think that is our fate.  But when we die the very act of death itself gives us a body.  The act of death makes our body and soul part of one.  So when we die our body and soul are one.

The very act of dying itself is what defines our ""soul"" or ""soul's destiny"" or whatever you want to call it.  I think this is something you need to really think about when you are dying.  I would encourage you to think about it.",0

This person will be born and die, and there will be a feast afterwards. But I don't think that's all there is to it. Jesus is the man, the son of God, and the son of man. The son of man is the person who acts, and the person who acts is the man. The man is the one who thinks, and the man who thinks is the person who acts.

I don't think our souls are bound into the physical world or that it is necessary for our eternal salvation (and we are redeemed and redeemed yet again).

I think that the physical world is a way to explore and experience our free will. It's a place of exploration, a place of learning, and a place of growth. However, we can't have a relationship with God outside of this physical realm.

The Christian belief that the Bible is the inerrant word of God (and it's actually pretty awesome) is an expression of our belief that the physical world holds a place for us. It's a way for us to learn about the world and be challenged by it.",0
"I find it interesting that people say that when we die we are given a soul.  What's interesting is that it's the same souls of the same people who have lived a life of sinning (who, from the Bible, will go to heaven) that are also given the same soul.  I think that's because it's not the sin of the individual that's the problem, but the sin of others.  The souls of the believers are given the same soul because that soul is the same one that Jesus died for.",0

I don't know enough to give you a more precise answer here, but I believe that Worf is referring to Odo as ""John Doe"" because he was the only Cardassian in Starfleet and Odo was the only Cardassian in the Federation at the time. This is why Worf was so quick to give Odo a Cardassian ID when he was able to prove he was a citizen of the Cardassian Union.",0
"I have a theory. 

We know that many of the Cardassian Founders were either born and raised on the Cardassian side of Bajor, or were born and raised on the Federation side of Bajor. Many were either refugees of war, or were not born and raised on Bajor, but were able to go there after the Occupation. 

So if Sisko is one of these refugees, he would have had a very good chance to have a Cardassian family for a long time, and would have lived a Cardassian life. But he was unable to because he is a Starfleet officer, and Cardassian law requires that anyone who is a citizen of Cardassia is called John Doe.

Sisko could have adopted a Cardassian name, but I don't think he would have wanted to. Instead, I think he went with the name of his Cardassian family as one of the few ways he was able to become not only a Federation citizen, but a Cardassian citizen. And the reason why he wanted to do this is because of all the Cardassian refugees that were in Starfleet at the time.

So to answer your question, because of the Cardassian refugees, he uses ""John Doe"" to avoid being identified as a Cardassian.",0
"The fact that he is a Cardassian citizen doesn't make him a Starfleet officer. It also doesn't make him a citizen of Cardassia. He is an officer of the Cardassian military, but Cardassia is not a Federation member and its ruler is not a Federation citizen.

Since the Federation doesn't recognize Cardassia as a sovereign state, Starfleet can't give him an official rank. It's also possible that Cardassia has its own laws and regulations that Cardassians use in Starfleet that don't conflict with Federation law.",0
"I'm gonna assume you're referring to the first season of DS9, where Sisko is referred to as John Doe by Jake and Dax, in reference to the fact that he's not a Cardassian citizen. I've been watching DS9 for the past 3 years or so, so I guess you could say I've seen most if not all of the episodes. 

To help with your answer to your question:

The only Cardassian that we actually see in Starfleet is Dax, from the moment of her arrival on DS9. We see Dax in various uniforms, and at various times (which is why it's so important that the Cardassians be able to track her down), but not as an officer. If you watch the episodes with Sisko, though, you'll see the Cardassians are more than capable of finding her (and her mother); Odo, at the very least, is certainly capable of locating Kira.

As for the reason why Sisko calls himself John Doe, I can't speculate fully, but I do think it's likely that he's trying to avoid being identified as one of the Cardassians. As you said, the Cardassians can track him, and we know from ""In Purgatory's Shadow"" that the Cardassians don't like Cardassians at all, especially if they can't identify them. The Cardassians were one of the few races that refused to help Starfleet with the Cardassian-Federation war, and it seems likely that they're the reason Sisko's parents were killed. Sisko even describes a Cardassian who was involved in a Cardassian-Federation war who ended up in the gulag.

Also, as I mentioned in my post, Sisko doesn't wear an arm band. This is because he's not a Cardassian citizen. This is mentioned in ""The Visitor."" As I understand it, the Cardassians do not recognize Federation citizens under arm bands; if they couldn't recognize Federation citizens with arm bands, there would not have been a Cardassian war in the first place.",0
"I think you're onto something. For the rest, it's all about the context.

First off, Sisko was never an officer. He was an enlisted crewman. There is nothing inherently wrong with being enlisted, but there is a stigma that's attached to it that would make him feel that he is not an officer. We know that Cardassians, if captured, are required to serve in Starfleet's military. That does not mean Sisko is an officer, and it is because of this that he feels he isn't one. 

Secondly, Sisko's family is from the Cardassian Union. He was not born on Cardassia Prime but on Odo's homeworld, and he is of Cardassian descent. As a result of this, he is not a Cardassian citizen. He was raised as one. He learned to be a Cardassian and to understand Cardassian culture from the Cardassian military. So he's never had the opportunity to go through the Cardassian citizen process of becoming one. 

I think this is a big part of being a ""Starfleet officer"" in the Federation. 

Lastly, Sisko is a ""Starfleet officer"" so he is trained to act like one. This is a result of Cardassian military training. A lot of what Starfleet does is trained and directed by the military. The military does not want officers who are not members of the military.",0
"I think Odo's status as a Federation citizen makes him one of the few humans to be able to serve aboard a Federation starship.  Given Sisko's reputation for being a ""good boy"" (and I mean that as an affectionate term, I believe) he might be reluctant to be labeled by the Founders as a Cardassian citizen.  He might be worried that his family will become an even more despised enemy of the Federation.  

Odo also may not be entirely convinced that he really is a Federation citizen as he was born outside the Federation.  He might be unsure just what is a Cardassian citizen and how the Federation determines what makes a Cardassian citizen.  

Lastly, Odo may not be able to remember the specific term that is used in the Federation for his people.  He may not even be sure that the term is used in Cardassian space.  He has been living in the Federation his whole life, but he remembers seeing that term as a child.",0

"The Feds have almost no chance of surviving the 24th century, even if they're able to fend off the Dominion. Their only hope is if they can find a way to create a singularity, but even then they are likely doomed.",0
"It has always been my suspicion that the Federation is on the brink of extinction at the same time as the Federation is the sole galaxy-wide spacefaring civilization left, and thus has only a small window of time to prepare.",0
"I'd argue that the Federation is on the brink of extinction simply because Earth is on the edge of no return. There's a number of factors that led to the Federation's current situation. First would be the Klingons. Without them Earth's empire would have been destroyed, and the Federation would most likely have been absorbed into the Klingon Empire. Second would be the Romulans. With their alliance with the Romulans on Earth they have had a major influence on the Federation. In addition, they have been very reluctant to intervene in the affairs of their rivals. Third is the Romulan Star Empire. As the Romulan Star Empire has been in a state of civil war for centuries their influence has been on the rise. This is evidenced by the Federation's constant war with the Romulans. There isn't a shortage of potential adversaries for the Federation.

As for the Borg, the Federation had some experience with the Borg, but they had to deal with a much superior foe in the Dominion. To quote the Federation President:

> ""This is the most powerful force in the quadrant, with the potential to become the dominant power in the Alpha Quadrant and potentially even the entire galaxy.""

The Dominion was not only far more powerful than the Borg but at the same time they were also far more technologically advanced. This is why the Dominion had no problems attacking the Federation, and why the Federation was able to counter the Borg. The Federation was able to counter the Borg because it had more experience dealing with the Dominion.

In addition to this, many Federation members, including Vulcan, whose ships are the envy of the quadrant, had not participated in the war against the Borg. They believed that the Federation would simply sit back and watch the Federation die, as they had failed to defend themselves against the Borg. Instead, as we see, the Federation was able to rally together to fight the Borg.",0
"I would argue that the Federation is on the brink of extinction.

I think the Federation's biggest problem is that their biggest advantage is the Federation. They have so many colonies and so many people, but when it comes down to it, the Federation can only afford to fight off a limited number of threats.

The Federation has become a galactic police system, and I think that's a mistake. Their resources are spread thinly and they can't afford to respond to every potential disaster.",0
"We know that the Federation is not dead, and we know the Borg are a threat.

The Federation is well stocked with all the resources it needs: ships, crew, and tech. The Federation has been in such a state of technological superiority that it can easily field a force of ships and soldiers that it can dispatch anywhere as is needed. The Borg use their fleet of cube-sized ships to do this.

The Federation ships are equipped to fight the Borg with every type of weapon available to them including phasers, disruptors, and the like, and it's a war against a single cube that is more difficult than the Borg know.

The Federation can also deploy more than one fleet at a time. We see a similar deployment of more than one fleet in ""The Neutral Zone"". The Federation needs more than one fleet to counter Borg cubes, and it can deploy any number of fleet and even more ships.

The Federation has a technological superiority that the Borg, a species who could not even be outmatched by the Federation, cannot match. The Federation can't even win a single battle against the Borg, and yet Starfleet has to mobilize at once to deal with the Borg because they can't win.

The Federation is on the brink of extinction because there is a small number of Borg cube's remaining that can defeat the Federation, leaving the Federation with no choice but to respond.",0

This is a great story, and I'd like to thank someone else for giving me such a great idea, the idea of a man with a shotgun and a woman with a pistol, and how they all could escape together with the help of a gun, and the idea of the car, but when it comes time to actually go to the garage, they're stuck in the car, and the car is stuck in the garage, with the man in the driver's seat and the old man in the passenger's seat, and they're stuck in the car, and I think it's time to go outside and take the gun out, and I just remembered that it's Friday night, and they're in the dark car, and I hope they don't find each other, and also they could probably help each other out.

"The case of [Erich Schmidt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Died:_January_25,_1980_in_Dresden,_Germany) in Germany. 

This man, who was a member of the SS, was a German-born American living in Germany. In 1983, he was captured by an Afghan guerrilla and executed.

I'm not completely sure about the details, but he was supposedly abducted by a group of Al Qaida fighters (I have no idea what to make of that, but it's a plausible story). When his family found out that he was missing, they contacted the FBI, but they couldn't do anything.

Finally, in 2014, the German police discovered where the body of the German man was buried and they found out that he had been shot and killed. The person who shot the German was actually a member of the Taliban.

There is one other strange thing about this case. According to one report I read, the body was buried in the same place where he was found, so the family felt uneasy about not being able to prove that he was killed on that spot.

"I am going to answer this in two parts. 

First, do you have a definition of the word ""human""?

When the machines are manipulating Neo, they are manipulating *him*. He is their tool. He is the physical manifestation of their will. They are manipulating him; he is their tool. What's most telling about that is the fact that the machines are using Neo, a human, to manipulate humans, humans that have no concept of being human. 

Second, what do you make of the notion that humans are in the Matrix, in the Matrix, in the Matrix? Do you believe humans are in the Matrix, in the Matrix, in the Matrix?

You can't be in the Matrix if you're not in the Matrix. Why? Because that *is* the Matrix. A universe in which humans exist. A universe in which the machines exist. A universe in which anything exists.

We exist in a multiverse, one in which humans exist. One in which the machines exist. One in which the humans exist. One in which the machines exist. 

The question of whether or not humans exist outside of the Matrix is irrelevant; the question of whether or not the Matrix exists outside of the Matrix is irrelevant; the question of whether or not humans exist outside of the Matrix is irrelevant. 

The question of whether or not humans exist outside of the Matrix is irrelevant. The only question is whether humans exist outside of the Matrix.",0
"I think the machines are more than machines, and the machines/humans are more than human. The machines are nothing but machines, but the human mind is the most powerful part of a human being. The machines are a perfect example of a flawed human being.",0
"I've only seen the first movie but I thought the Matrix was about how humans are slaves to the Machines. The second movie takes that idea further by being about how humans can be slaves to the Machines as well. The first movie is about the Machines, the second movie is about the humans. 

The machines are machines and the humans are humans, the Machine and the person are one and the same, but the Machine and the person are not connected to each other.",0
I think it's the idea of human nature being manipulated by the machines.  Humans have a tendency to use and abuse power.  That's what humans do.  Humans can also sometimes be manipulative.  I think it's a good way of exploring the idea that any type of power is used and abused in the human experience.  Humans tend to abuse power.  Whether it's the power to create or to destroy.  And humans tend to abuse the power they have.,0
"I think the ""human nature being manipulated by the use of power"" is a big theme too, but I think I agree with you more that the human nature being manipulated by the use of power and the human nature being manipulated by the use of the machines are intertwined. 

Neo was in the Matrix because the Matrix was trying to control him and get him into the Matrix. That theme is present throughout the trilogy. It's a big part of why the Machines would want to manipulate people, because people can be controlled by the use of power.

The machines are machines, and the machines are machines. Machines are machines, humans are humans. Humans are humans, machines are machines.

I think the ""human nature being manipulated by the machines"" theme is present in the first film, but much more subtly.

I think the Matrix trilogy, to me, is about the consequences of the use of power.",0
"The Matrix Trilogy is basically a story about the concept of power being used to manipulate the collective. Every character in the Matrix is a symbol of the power of the collective. Neo represents the average person, who has been manipulated into buying into this system. The machines represent the government, who is using their power to control the population, to manipulate the collective. The humans represent the collective, who are manipulated into believing this system is good, when it is not. When you watch the movies, take a look at the people in the movie. They are all trying to be the best person they can be, and are all trying to do what is best for them, because that is what is best for the collective.

Each character has the same power in the Matrix, and is manipulated in the same ways.",0

"""*I'll be in the back.""*""

I turn around, the door to my old study is just about to close when I hear the words.

I'm back in my day, this time in a wheelchair. As I sit down I feel my body start to loosen up. I let out a deep sigh of relief. 

I was a long way from home, and here I am. Sitting in my very own study, with my very own cup of coffee. It's a good day to be alive.

I look to the back of my desk. ""Oh, it looks like it's time for round two."" I say to myself. I turn it off and go to the bathroom. I'm not going to the bathroom, I want to see if there's any way to kill myself.

I head to the bathroom when I hear the unmistakable sound of an axe. I run out of the bathroom and see nothing but a chair, a cabinet, and some old books. I think, ""Why not kill myself this time?""

I head back into the study and sit down. I've never seen anything like this before. It's a very old place. I feel the chair, see a book, and get up to examine them. I open the book and it's about a book in history. ""What the hell? Well, I'd better read this, I guess."" I pick up the book and take a peek at the title.

*The Art of Murder*.

I look over the title and the first few paragraphs are about a murderer. It explains all about the various ways to commit murder and the different ways his body could change.

He was given the power to see the future, at the cost of immortality. He was given a small staff, which allowed him to control his future. He had the power to change his appearance.

I'm in shock. I'd never heard that in any book. I'm even more shocked when I take a look at the cover of the book. It's the same cover I saw the first time I saw the book.

I sit down on the chair and start reading through the book. Before I finish, my chair starts to shake. I start to panic.

""...And that's how the murder weapon started.""",0

""I will not,"" The man replied, ""I *will* die, I will die!""

""No, you won't, you *will* die!"" The woman shouted. ""I have been told I will die. I have been told I will die. I *will* die! I *will* die!""

""And I know,"" The man said, ""I know.""

""Why didn't you kill me? Why did you have to shoot me? What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm sorry.""

The man in the alley was in tears and was running in the opposite direction. The man in the middle of the alley started to chase him, and the man in the alley had to shoot the man in the alley in the arm.

""Fuck you, you bastard. I don't care what you do. Just kill me already.""

The man in the alley took out a gun and aimed it at the man in the alley.

""I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry.""

The man in the alley opened the car door and started to drive away.

"I don't know what's more frightening-the death of a man or a god.

The man had been an incredible man. He had led his kingdom from a barren wasteland into something that was a beacon of prosperity and happiness. He had been the first in his kingdom to graduate from the academy, and the first to reach the pinnacle of his career. He had brought his entire country to the forefront of peace and prosperity, and had built a lasting legacy that would be remembered for centuries to come.

The woman had been a part of the man's life for all of his years, and had raised his children to be the best of their generation.

There was a point that I know I can't tell you. I will tell you that when the man was no longer the man, but the god.

"It's been a long time since I've had to kill someone. 

I've never been a man to fear death, and the idea of it just seems like a curse. 

I can't remember what it was like when I was a child. I can't remember how people reacted to death, I can't remember the first time I felt the need to kill.

When I was a child, my father beat me. Then my mother beat me. Then my brother beat me. Then my sister beat me. Then my mother beat me. The list goes on and on with the beatings. 

As time has passed, I've grown to understand how it is that people fear death. They fear it because they've been beaten and killed so many times, and they don't want it to happen again. 

I've decided to kill my wife.

I can't kill her, though, she's my wife. I've lived with her for twenty five years. 

My brother beats me. And he never will. He always has to go beat me. He's old and his skin is gray. He's always a few years older than me and always has a few more years before he can beat me. 

My sister beats me. She's my sister. I love her dearly. She's always been kind and always has been there for me. 

My mother beats me. She was a sweet woman and always loved me. She beat me so much, so much it didn't matter how many times I begged her not to. 

My father beats me. He's a good man. A good man from the way he raised me, from the way he's always treated me. He always comes home to me after work, and he always knows what to do when I'm feeling down. He always makes sure I'm okay. 

When I was a child, I was beaten. I've never been the same person. I can't even remember when it began, but I can remember the years of beatings. I can remember them all. 

It feels like it's time to stop. Time to just kill myself. I just want to know that they'll be okay. I just want them to be okay. 

I've been a man for twenty five years, and I can't remember the last time I cried. I can't remember the last time I told a lie.",0
"It's always been a nightmare. When I was young at my house, I had a dream.

I was smiling, and happy.
The reflection in the mirror was a woman, a beautiful woman.
No matter how hard I tried to forget her.
The reflection in the mirror was not my wife, my wife was dead long ago.

But the reflection in the mirror was my own reflection, and I was happy.

"This is hard to do but maybe you could try being more vocal. I have a friend who does this and she says it helps a lot.

Or perhaps use your hands too.",0
Maybe I am being an asshole here but I think you are just not enjoying your orgasms.,0
"I have this problem also, and it's because I'm a little too relaxed during and after sex. My partner is always telling me to relax and to make sure I'm not grinding too hard or grinding too slow, but it's hard to do that when I'm so happy and relaxed. I always end up doing something that seems like it's going to be a good idea at the time and then it just doesn't feel good.",0
"The first thing I noticed about a woman's orgasms is how long she'll last. It's not uncommon for me to cum in less than a minute if I'm really horny. It really is very difficult for women to maintain that kind of intensity when they're tired, physically and mentally.

The other thing I noticed was that I orgasm much much much sooner than my partners. I don't know if it's physiological or psychological, but for me, orgasms can feel very very similar to a stomach ache. I can't really explain it, but I'm extremely sensitive and it's like my body just goes ""whoops, you just had a really painful orgasm. Let's try to fix that.""

I understand that it's really frustrating for you to not be able to get rid of your partner and you shouldn't have to deal with that. But it's also really frustrating for you and it's not fair to your partner. Have you tried anything to change the way you orgasm? Have you tried anything to make it easier for you to get off?

One thing I can tell you is that if you're not getting good orgasms from your partner, have you tried talking to him about it? Does he feel like you shouldn't be feeling that way?",0
"If I remember right from my sex ed classes, the ideal is for the man to provide the full body massage while the woman is performing oral sex.  I think it was said that it may help with the muscles contracting during orgasm.  

I've never had a problem with orgasming, but I've had my share of orgasming problems.  I found I had to focus on my clitoris and relax.  I also found it helpful to work on other parts of my body while I was masturbating.  It can help to get the muscles in your pelvic region to contract and relax at the same time.  

I hope that helps!",0
"The first few times I had a clitoral orgasm, I was so frustrated after I finally did that that I just stopped immediately. It had nothing to do with the orgasm I had and everything to do with the fact that I was so worried I was going to fuck it up and ruin it. So I just stopped having orgasms altogether until I could calm down. And when I calmed down, I had no problems with clitoral orgasms.

So the advice you are looking for is this: get comfortable with the idea that you might not get to orgasm every time you have sex. And then try and relax. Try to control your breathing. Try to relax. When you're relaxed, you can have the most intense orgasm you've had in a long time. And the only thing that can help you relax is to have sex.",0
"I'm a guy and don't really have a solution to your problem. If you're going to have trouble with orgasms you should probably see a doctor. 

I think it's a mix of psychological and physiological factors. You may be frustrated because it feels like you're failing at it. It's normal to feel like you're not enough. You just have to know that if you keep trying you'll eventually get to where you want to be.

I'm also a bit confused about why you didn't have a strong orgasm the second day. It may not have been due to the first day being bad for you. The first day is usually a lot easier because the vagina has become more lubricated. You may just need to be mindful of what you're doing during foreplay.",0
"I'm a guy and I have some experience with this. 

I had a hard time with it as well when I was younger too, and I'd say that the reason I took so long to cum was probably because I was trying to focus on it too much. I think it's actually pretty normal and to be expected. 

I think that the only thing you really have to worry about is that you're focusing on it too much. I'd say that you were focused on it too much before you cum. 

The key for you is to just relax and keep focusing on whatever is making you cum. 

My general advice is to just try and relax, and focus on whatever is making you cum. Focus on it enough and it'll eventually start working for you. Keep trying, and eventually it'll work for you.

I'm not sure what kinds of things your trying, but relax. Focus on your partner, and just try and focus on whatever is making you cum. 

In my experience, it's not too much to focus on a certain part of your body. Just try and focus on that area and you'll eventually get there.",0
"I haven't been able to orgasm from vaginal sex for years. I was on medication for a while and have been off them for about six months. 

If the pill is your problem, I suggest talking with your doctor. He should be able to help.

If it's something else, like a yeast infection, I'd suggest you see your gynecologist. You can get a prescription for vaginal rings that should work. I've worn one for about a year and a half and I have had no problems. 

You're not alone, don't give up.",0
"I'm so sorry you're having such a hard time. 

There is a lot of misinformation online on this topic. 

First, there is not a lot of science backing up the idea that orgasm is a complex phenomenon that requires a multitude of factors. There is no consensus in the medical community that orgasm is a complex phenomenon that requires a multitude of factors. 

We know it's a chemical response, but the mechanisms behind this chemical response are not understood. This is not to say that complex things can't be complex. There are more than a few simple things we know about in life. 

For example, the fact that we need to think about oxygen, the ability to regulate our body temperature, the ability to get out of a situation, etc. etc. is simple. That doesn't mean all of these things are simple. 

For example, we know that if we run out of oxygen, we can't use our eyes. That doesn't mean that the physical world is more complex than the brain. They are all simple biological processes, but they are all the same in that they are all a part of our body. 

So when we think about ""orgasm"" we need to think about a whole bunch of different factors. Our brains are very complicated, so to speak, but they are not complex enough to make any claim about what an orgasm is. 

I think you are confusing the psychological/emotional component of orgasm in with the physical component of orgasm. When we experience orgasm, we are in a unique place in our lives that we can't really describe. It's not that we're not able to experience it, it's that we have a hard time describing it in ways that are helpful to you. 

So I think what is helping you with this is the fact that you are trying to describe the physical components of orgasm but the physical components of orgasm are not the whole story.",0

"I can answer this for the most part.

We are in a constant state of sleep. This is the time that the body is most active and can repair cells. This is also where we can be most ""rested"" at.

We also eat at various times throughout the day (if we are doing other activities at that time), depending on our activity level. These are called ""fasting"" periods. At all times when we are fasting, our body is in a constant state of sleep.

When we go from a fasted period to eating, our body is now in a state of rest and repair. This is the time where the body is most active and has a need to be ""recharged"" in a good way.

When we are eating, the body is actively trying to repair itself. This is why the body has a need to eat.

"Don't worry about how to defend a queen attack. It is completely normal to be down pieces when your opponent has a queen and there is nothing you can do to stop it. 

You also need to remember that queens are not only a problem when they attack d3, but also when they attack your pawns.

As for what to do with the white king, it also depends on where the king is on the board. If you are in the d file with the black queen, I would probably keep your king on d file and try to castle. The white queen on b5 is not a problem since you still have your pawns protecting your king.

If the white queen attacks your king, you then have a number of options:

1. If you are already in the king's corner try to trade queens on the next turn and make your king the only one in the king's corner.

2. Take the white queen with your king.

3. Try to push your king out diagonally so that the white knight can get to that position.

4. Send your queen to a better place. For example, after you take the white queen, you can attack the black king (if it is white) with your queen.

You can also play:

5.Pawn to d1, push e1 knight into the enemy king.

"I don't think the Federation would have gone to war with the Klingons.  The Federation wouldn't have been at peace with them, and they would absolutely have been at war with them.

In fact, I'd say that the Federation would have been at war with the Klingons, and then went to peace with them.

Consider, for a moment, a scenario where the Federation never made peace with the Klingons, because they were at war with them.  This is what the Dominion did.

Imagine the Federation never made peace with them, because they were at war with them.  That's what the Dominion did.

But the Federation doesn't make peace with the Klingons, because they are at war with them.  So there is a conflict between what the Federation *is* and what it *should* be.  The Federation *is* peace with them, because they *should* be peace with them, but they *are* at war with them, and what they *should* be peace with them is war with them.

First of all, the Klingon Empire existed in the 23rd and 24th century. It's a little bit later than TOS, and TMP, but it's definitely post TOS.

Secondly, the Federation had a war with the Romulans just as bad, and as far as we know, there wasn't as much to be gained by a war with the Klingons. The Federation is not the Federation of today.

Thirdly, the Klingons are not very technologically advanced, and their warp drive is not that great either, so the Federation would have been a lot more powerful in comparison.

Fourthly, even if the Federation did have a war with the Klingons, it would be a pretty long war, and would most likely end with the Klingons and their Romulan allies being at least in a sort of stalemate, because of the Klingons' technological superiority and their unwillingness to fight the Federation.",0

"George Washington Caro: 

>George Washington Caro was the only member of the New York Provincial Congress (1770) to live past the age of thirty. But he didn't get to enjoy the spoils of retirement. He was killed by an Indian in 1774. The cause of this unfortunate accident was a misunderstanding between the two men. Washington Caro took his horse to Buffalo to hunt buffalo and ended up killing an Indian who was hunting buffalo with an Indian. The Indian who killed Washington Caro claimed he did so in self-defense.

>The Indian who had killed Washington Caro was killed in a similar way, but it was accepted that Washington Caro's horse would have killed the Indian, and, in any case, George Washington Caro was not the one who killed the Indian. His brother's son, Alexander Caro, claimed that he was the one who killed Washington Caro in his own defense.

"The Indian who killed Washington Caro was killed by another Indian in a fight in the vicinity of the Seneca village. Washington Caro had shot the Indian who had killed another Indian.

Alexander Caro died the following day and Washington Caro was dead, although he was buried in the village.

As long as they're not being exploited, they will be able to buy what they want and what they need. If the capitalists are out to make profit, they will make enough profit to give people what they want.

I'm a classical liberal, and believe that the best way to do things is to get people comfortable with them. I believe that the best way to do things is to let people live the life they want to live without force, and force them to live with the consequences of their actions.

"The values of functions are not a set, they are not a function, they are not an expression, they are not a mathematical symbol, they are something else.

For your first question ""what is the value of f(z) = z^2/4 + 3?"" you do not have to know the value of f(z). The only thing you need to know is that f(z) = z^2/4 + 3. 

For your second question you just need to know the value of the function f(x) = x^2/4 + 2.",0
"1. The only difference between f(x) = x and f(x) = z^2/4 + 3 is the function name. It's not really a different function.

2. The value f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 is given by the function f(z) = z^2/4 + (z^2/4 + 3).

3. The value of f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 is given by the function f(z) = z^2/4 + (z^2/4 + 3).",0
"In the case of f(x) = f(x - 2) +2, you can't simply use z^2/4 + 3. That's because z^2/4 is not a valid function, z^2/4 = z^2 and by definition z^2 = 1. However, you could use z^2/4 = z^2 and it would still be not a valid function. You could use z^2/4 = z^2 + 3 and it would still be not a valid function. You could use z^2/4 = z^2 - 3 and it would still be not a valid function. So I guess z^2/4 = 1 can't be used.

In the case of f(x) = z^2/4 + 3, it's a little easier. You can rewrite the function f(x) = z/4 + 3 as f(x) = 1/x, which is what you want. That's why z/4 + 3 is the same as z + 3.

If you want to know the value of any function, you have to do a bit of work. You need to know how many terms you have in a series and how many terms you have in a fraction. After you've done this, you can use the formula to determine the value of the function.

So, to simplify your problem, you need to find the value of the function f(z) = x^2/4 + 3.

You can find out how much value you have by doing the same thing as you did above. I would take f(x) = z^2/4 + 3 and find z = 1/x, which will give you z = 1.

In the case of f(x) = z^2/4 + 3, you can find out how much value you have by doing the same as you did above. I would take f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 and find z = 1/z, which will give you z = 2.",0

"1) You can think of the derivative as:

f(z) - (z-2)(z-2) = (z-2)(z-2) - (z-2)(z-2) = f(z)

For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2/4 + 3 is

f(x) - (x-2)(x-2) = (x-2)(x-2) - (x-2)(x-2) = (x-2)(x-2) - (x-2)(x-2) = f(x)

2) You can think of the derivative of f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 as

f(z) - (z-2)(z-2) = -z^2/4 + 3

For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2/4 + 3 is

f(x) - (x-2)(x-2) = -2x^2/4 + 3

3) You can think of the derivative of f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 as

f(z) - (z-2)(z-2) = -2z^2/4 + 3

For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2/4 + 3 is

f(x) - (x-2)(x-2) = -2z^2/4 + 3

So basically, we can think of the derivative of a function f(z) as f(z-2)(z-2)/2 + (z-2)(z-2)/2 - (z-2)(z-2)/2 = (z-2)(z-2)/2 - (z-2)(z-2)/2 = f(z-2)(z-2)",0

So at a young age, I am exposed to a lot of the world and information, and I will absorb that information with my own experiences, and in a way, I will also make sense of it.

Also, I think the very fact that you go from zero knowledge to knowing everything is also a process of ""knowing"" as a thing, rather than a process of ""having knowledge"".",0
"Well as it turns out, the Klingons have a concept of ""pratium"" which basically means learning through experience, and the Klingons have a lot of experience with warfare and warfare tactics in general.

So, if we're going to pretend that the K'darid have a similar philosophy, then their method of teaching Klingon is probably a bit different.

K'Tara: ""We do not teach the Klingon warrior to read, write, or even to count. We only teach him to fight.""

K'Tara: ""If you want to know how we teach our warriors, it is by fighting.""

K'Tara's point is that a warrior who is not fighting will not know the significance of what he's doing and will not have any effect on the larger Klingon society, so we need to start young.

So, there you have it: Klingon children are taught by their elders, and there is a lot of combat training in Klingon society that includes an emphasis on fighting.

That's not to say that Klingon society isn't also taught about technology and science (e.g. during childhood), or that Klingon society doesn't have a very strong influence on a younger Klingon's behavior (e.g. the Klingon ""pratizh"", or the Klingon ""fight or flight"" response).

But yes, Klingons tend to be very focused on combat, and it's not an accident that Klingons who have been raised in Klingon society frequently show this focus on combat, as a result of the K'darid Klingon concept of ""pratium"".",0
"I think a lot of it has to do with the person's ability to form their own opinions and opinions based on what other people think.

To see the Klingon language is to experience a language that is fundamentally different to any other language that we speak.

To experience the Klingon language we have to go into Klingon Academy. There we meet the Klingon language, the Klingon people, their culture, their traditions. There we form our own opinions and opinions based on what we see, hear, and imagine.

As a result, there are a lot of Klingons that have heard the Klingons are ruthless and do not like them, but the Klingon Empire still lives on. A Klingon who has been to Klingon Academy can go from zero knowledge to all knowledge in a very short amount of time.

The Klingon Empire thrives because of the Klingons and the Klingons make the Empire thrive.

A Klingon with the Klingon language and culture and language memorization, but no knowledge of Klingon culture and language can never have the knowledge to be part of the Klingon Empire. It has been passed down by word of mouth from the mother to the child.

That is why the Klingon Empire is so strong.",0
"* Pushing a child to learn about what you think is an unfamiliar thing. This could be a difficult task for a child with little experience to begin with.  If you have a child that is particularly interested in a topic then you might find that your work is in vain.
* Pushing a child to explore their own thoughts on what they are taught by something that is not of their own making. This works especially well for those who come from an education system who encourages a student to explore their own thought process and question it at every opportunity.",0
"They have to figure out the underlying principles before they can work backwards. That is what the Vulcans had to do because they were so limited in what they could do. The knowledge is acquired through training, and only the most dedicated and powerful can attain the necessary training.",0
"Well, if you're talking about, say, history, that's usually the result of education. If you're talking about current events, that's usually the result of a few key things happening.

* First, a well-informed person is likely to be well-informed about current events. Someone who knows a lot about the Middle Ages is unlikely to be aware of all the current events which are in the Middle Ages.
* Second, a well-informed person is likely to know what people who are well-informed about current events are likely to be aware of. If I don't know what is going on in the Middle Ages, I'm not likely to know what is going on in the world today. It's quite difficult to avoid being aware of current events in all their aspects; if you don't know what's happening in the Middle Ages, you'll be unaware of all the events happening in the Middle Ages.

A simple example is that if a well-informed person knows that the Middle Ages are over, they tend to know that the Middle Ages are over and that the Middle Ages are over and probably also have some ideas about what's going on in the world today (the Middle Ages are over, the Middle Ages are over, the Middle Ages are over).

On top of that, the well-informed person is likely to be well-informed about current events.

So if you want to know what's going on in the world today, you need to know what's going on in the world today, and the people who know what's going on in the world today know what's going on in the world today.",0
"I think it's more like a self-teaching process where a person, no matter what their age, will learn how to talk to anyone about anything.  Most people have to learn that they can't just ask for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer, but they also have to learn that they *can* ask for a ""how.""  I think this was a big part of Starfleet's success with Riker over the years.

Of course, as we know, Riker was already a super-genius, so that probably wasn't the key.  Riker would have to learn the basics, then work his way up.  I think that was a huge part of Picard's success as well, where he was already an excellent captain, but he didn't need to know things like ""how do you stop a car in space?"" or ""how do you make a warp core breach?""",0
"I always thought there was an important distinction between knowledge and understanding.

People know things they are taught, people know things that are learned from experience. A person who has no idea of how the world works can be a very brilliant or very dumb, depending on how they choose to learn of it.",0
"Most importantly, a person who is ignorant of certain things generally tends to have a very limited range of knowledge about those same things, but it's often enough to get by in day to day life. 

Having a new-to-you person be exposed to the *exact* same thing as someone who already ""knows"" a subject, often enough to give that person the exact same kind of knowledge, is a recipe for disaster.",0
"It's not easy. The first step is to give the person a reason to learn. If you're just taking the kid to work or to school, this is easier. If you make them watch documentaries or read a book, you still need to have some kind of introduction to the subject. Then, you give them a lot of material to digest. That can be a good way to make someone ""get"" something because it's so new and surprising. Then, you have to explain all the ways in which it's different to other ways of doing things, but still similar enough that the learner can figure out why. That's when the real learning starts.

The next step is to make the learner feel smart. That means making sure it's interesting and informative and that the learner is interested. That includes making sure they have some idea of what they're supposed to do, what their purpose is, and what to do exactly. If a kid is just learning about the moon landing and asks you about it, there's really not much you have to do with him.

If you keep going with this, it's possible the student will learn everything by osmosis. Eventually, the student will just think they know everything about the subject, and you can just take them out of the class at any time without having to explain anything.",0
"I think in a nutshell it's about the same way you come to know your friends. You grow up with them watching you do stuff, they know you do it and you know them. Eventually, you know all of them by name and have them all in your head.

With a teacher, you're watching them teach their students, and you know what they're saying. You know it's what they're doing and how they're doing it. You're a student and you have a teacher. Eventually you know them by name and think about them all day.

In the same way, a new person comes to know all of the major Starfleet characters by being exposed to them at a young age. They grow up with them, they know them in their mind and they know them by name. Eventually, they know all of them by name and think about them all day.",0

>Is it possible for singularity to happen in our lifetime?

I think it's likely, yes, but I do not think it's ""likely""

The singularity is a very good description of what's going to happen, and it's very likely. It's more likely than a lot of other things that are called 'deterministic'.",0
"The singularity is not a single event, it is the most likely outcome of exponential technological growth.  You can see the technological growth of the past 50 years in the last 100 years in the next 50.

The singularity does not have a point where it just stops.  It goes on indefinitely.  And it is not linear.

The singularity is a continuous process.  It is exponential, like exponential growth.

That being said, there are many predictions of what the singularity will be.  From AGI, to post-singularity, to FTL travel.  A few of them are not unrealistic.  I like the Singularity Institute predictions, but they are not realistic all the time.",0
It is possible that we may reach singularity before our lifetimes.,0
"I think that the problem is that the singularity isn't a problem. We are not facing a problem. There is no singularity.

The only singularity threat is that people will lose faith in humans. People will not be able to do things that are not aligned with our programming, and this will cause society to collapse.

The singularity is not a problem; we are living in the singularity.",0
"The singularity is a thing we do not know. It's a possibility, but we don't know it's *impossible.*

It's going to happen. The question is how do we get from here to there?

For it to be impossible to be an AI, there would have to be a god-like AI as well. We might not see it, but it's possible.",0
"I've been thinking about it too. I'm not really sure. I think it's possible, but I think we're not going to see it for a long time. I think the current rate of technological change (we're only really just starting to see major changes that will be seen for decades before the singularity) is about a billion times faster than it would have been in 2000 (though that was a time of tremendous change, too).

To me, the singularity is sort of the end of the human race, and the next time we see a big technological shift probably won't be for about 200,000 years. If we reach AGI or ASI, it will be a lot like the invention of the computer. We'll see the computers that are smarter than us. Then we can just go a billion times smarter than us. That will probably happen about 10 years after we reach AGI or ASI. 

That's what I'd like to see.",0

"I'm going to go with a conventional war. The Klingons are probably a little more intelligent than the Federation, and I don't see the Federation having the resources to wage an all out war. Their military might, once they've got the Federation on the back foot would be very hard to overcome. They would have the resources to do it, but the Federation has a very, very good chance of winning.",0
"I imagine that in the event of a Klingon-Federation conflict, they would fight a conventional war.  I agree it would be difficult to go to war with the Klingons without risking some kind of genocide of both sides.

As for the Klingons, I presume they would try to fight back, but they would probably become more and more desperate as the war progressed.  They'd probably become even more isolationist, and would do their best to avoid the Federation, but only in the event that they were forced to.  I imagine that they would, at some point, try to enter the war with a preemptive attack.  If that failed, they would try to negotiate and reach some kind of agreement that would put their entire people in a better position.  They probably would not have any way to do this, so it probably wouldn't be worth the risk.

I imagine that if the two sides were in full-scale war, then the Federation would continue to support the Klingons in some way.  Eventually, they would probably turn to their only real ally, the Romulans, and rely on them to help them fight the Klingons.  I imagine that Romulans and Klingons would get along well, and the Romulans would use the Klingons as cannon fodder.

I can't imagine the Klingons ever joining the Federation, because one, I don't think they ever had the ability to do so.  Two, I don't think they would be able to survive an invasion of the Klingon Empire.  The Federation would be able to provide them with plenty of supplies, and would probably be able to provide them with advanced technology.",0
"The Federation doesn't have a standing army. As far as I'm aware, Starfleet only has a small number of ships and is mainly composed of ships from civilian space (although that number has been increased recently). They have several outposts in Klingon space but even if the Klingons were aggressive, I doubt they have the capacity to carry out an invasion of Federation space. 

The Klingons had a treaty with the Federation, but I'm not sure if it was violated. Since they never signed a peace treaty, I'm not sure how or when the Klingon Empire could have broken the treaty. Klingon ships are not equipped for long range travel and Starfleet has no way of stopping the Klingons from sending in ships from Klingon space.",0
What I think the Federation would do is go to war with the Klingons by using their own technology to disable their ships. I think the Federation would just start off with that approach to defeat the Klingons.,0
"There are many different possible outcomes to a war, and all of them are not good. It's really up to our imagination, and whether we want to risk the lives of our loved ones to stop the enemy from doing whatever it is that we don't like, or whether we want to risk a conventional war and destroy the enemy's ability to do what it wants, and kill our loved ones in the process.",0
It depends on who you were talking to.  I'd say that the Federation would almost certainly go to war with the Klingons but not by overwhelming force as a preemptive strike would lead to a war with the Klingons and a war with the Federation would result in the Klingons losing that war.  The Federation would do all of their research to find out who the Klingons were and destroy them from the get go.,0

"I have the same problem.

I have a pair of jeans that I've had for a while now, and I have no idea how they fit. I can have them tailored. 

The jeans are made of polyester, which doesn't usually stretch, and even if they did it wouldn't do anything for the fit.

I'm trying to go for a more casual/streetwear style, so I need my clothes to fit well.

I've worn the jeans for a couple of months now, and I can't feel my legs from the back anymore. They are too tight in the thighs.

I can't find any pants in my size that fit, and the only other ones I can find are $40+ jeans.

I'm willing to pay $40 to see if I can find a pair of Levi 511s that fit, if that will help.

This was a problem for me, too, in the beginning of my career, but now I just buy new clothes.",0

"I used to be a big fan of video games but I just realized it's a waste of my time. I don't want to be involved with a game all day. I don't want to just buy a game and play for 30 hours. I'm just not a fan of games.

I'm currently learning how to be more social and I'm finding it really difficult to do things that require a lot of people. I need a little bit of time to figure out how to get involved with groups and I'm not sure how to do it.

I'm also trying to build a better relationship with my parents and have them help me out with small tasks. I'm trying to let them help me out more and also to take more initiative. 

Other than that, I'm trying to be more careful and careful with money. I'm saving up for tuition and I want to make things happen on that front.

Also, what are some hobbies that aren't gaming that you can get into? I like reading.",0
"I know a lot of people that have this same problem. They just find a few times a week to start playing video games and that's all they do for the rest of the day. It takes a bit of time to find an hour of time to just sit down and just play. I really recommend you try to go to a friends house with an hour or two of spare time and play games with them, maybe do a couple of fun little quests/tasks. 

Also a lot of people over look how much better it can be to have a hobby outside your regular school/work routine. I'd highly recommend you look into joining a sports team or a band/dance group. They're great ways to build social skills and just be part of something.",0
"It's all about your mindset. If you believe that you are doing well in life then you are. If you think that you should have done a better job of doing something then that's your problem.

"I have a few tips for you. 

When you are in your room, look at the clock in your room as soon as you wake up. You don't have much time to do anything here and you need to get to work or you will be late. 

Set a goal for yourself. Write it down so that you can follow through. 

When you have a goal set up, take a few minutes and decide on what you will do when you get there. 

Plan things as you go. 

When you have been working for a while, try to go to bed a bit earlier. 

When you have taken a few days off, take a few days off. 

When you have taken a few weeks off, go to sleep earlier. 

If you are stuck in a rut, don't beat yourself up. 

Don't stress because you are too lazy to get out of bed. 

Don't get stressed because of something outside of your control. 

It is possible to make changes and do things when you are bored. 

Be patient. 

When you feel like you are ready, get up and do your thing. 

When you get to a point where you are comfortable, stop. 

There is always another side to every story and sometimes things just don't happen and this is the way it has to be.

2. Eat a lot. You'll feel better. If you have a lot of junk food at home, buy yourself a couple of packs of ramen, a couple of cans of diet Coke, a couple of beef jerky, a couple packs of cheese, and a couple of apples.
3. Exercise. Get in the gym, do some push ups and sit ups, start running.
4. Watch some youtube videos. I love watching a kid do acrobatics and stuff.
5. Make a YouTube channel. I did it last year, and I just uploaded a few of my videos to my youtube channel.
6. Go on a couple of YouTube Gaming Profiles. I think you should do all of the stuff on that, but specifically start out with video games. Watch some tutorials, play some games, and have fun!
7. Try to take some online classes, especially in the computer science or science fields.
8. Go to the gym. If you have a computer in your room, set it up to play Minecraft, and try out some of the games.",0

"I would only recommend the program if you want to work out for a long time, and for the time being you can just do the program as a beginner. If you want to work out for a long time, you should do the program as a beginner.",0
"I'd do the program. You just need to add some more things to it, and if you can do them all without having to rest, you should. You have to do all the work, but you don't have to do all the work every day.",0
Why not start with a light weight and work up?,0
"It's hard to train for the first 3-4 months (as you do more than you should).  That being said, the first 3-4 months are going to be a grind.  You know you want to do it, but you're still trying to get in shape, so you just can't focus fully on it.  It's going to be a long slog, so plan your workouts as best as you can.  Start with your main lifts (deadlifts/squats/bench press/ohp) and build up to them.  Also, do more than what you need to, but maybe the next time you do it, do more than you're doing now.

My recommendation if you're new to lifting is to start with the weight you need to lift at a higher weight.  If after a month or so, you're still not making progress, then start a program like 5/3/1 with one or two additional sets at a lower weight.  Your form will be better because you're working hard, and you'll be able to continue to increase your weight and you'll have more time to work on things you need.",0
"Well the thing is for most beginner programs, you need to be able to follow a workout plan and not have to worry too much about what you are doing wrong, the amount of weight you can complete and the right exercises. 

If you are really new to weights, you should definitely try the beginner program I mentioned. You can always read some info on the website or on the FAQ, but there's a lot of information out there to help you get started. 

In the beginner program, you always start with the basics. I would start with the bench press, biceps, legs, arms (pushups, handstand pushups, crunches, etc.), cardio, core etc.

Once you are doing some of those basic exercises, you can start working in your own stuff and work on your own stuff. 

The beginner program does have a few advanced workouts which I assume you're still trying to work into your routine. These are some of them:

1) Deadlift
2) Squat
3) Shoulder Press
4) Military Press
5) Pushups
6) Handstand Pushups
7) Crunches
8) Ab exercises

Once you have done all of those, you can start moving on to the more advanced workouts. 

For example, if you're still struggling with the pushups, I would recommend to start doing them with dumbells. If you're not able to do the pushups, just do 2 sets of 3 pushups. After you've done those, you can start doing other ab exercises like sit-ups, crunches etc. This will allow you to work on those muscles. 

When it comes to the program, the only things that you really need to worry about is the exercises and the total volume of the program. The rest is just for extra motivation and variety. 

The only thing that I think you need to do is the warm up sets because I don't know if you can do your warm up sets with a dumbbell. You can't really warm up with your hands so I would recommend using a barbell.",0

I dreamt about dying 2 nights ago too. I got run over by a car while walking my dog. I almost died and now I am in another world where I don't know where I am. I have been having dreams like this for years but now they are more realistic.,0
I have had dreams of dying very similar to this. I'm not sure if they mean anything. It's just really weird.,0
"For some people, the way they die is often linked to the way they die in the future. That's why, for example, people who are religious will often have dreams of dying by being tortured in hell, or people who are pessimistic will often have dreams of dying by being crushed or burned alive.

However, it's important to remember that dreams are usually more symbolic than literal. I think it would be more likely, if you were actually dying, you'd have a much more emotional reaction in your dreams. I think it's a good sign that you're able to recognize your dream symbolism, but more importantly, I think it's important to remember that dreams are a way of processing all of the things in your life that you want to express to yourself, and sometimes they seem to go a bit overboard.",0
"You have to figure out if you are worried about something in your life or if you are worried about the possibility of losing your loved ones. I would recommend writing down the major dreams you had and see if you can come up with anything specific. Then, use a dream dictionary to see if there are certain words or ideas that have meaning.",0
"There are many ways to interpret these dreams.  The first thing is if you are feeling lost in the world or if you are feeling disconnected from the people who matter to you.  To me, that sounds like a sense of selflessness or a loss of connection to those around you.  In your dreams, you are trying to find or reconnect with that sense of selflessness.  To find it means to be open to others and to understand that the people you know and love are people you are not connected to.  You are looking for it in other people, because it is a feeling that cannot be found in yourself.",0
"I think the dreams are telling you that you are still trying to deal with something that you haven't dealt with yet. Like the first dream I have had has involved my childhood friend (also a childhood friend) I killed her. I had to live with the guilt of it for a long time and it just came out in the dream. 

In the second dream I had I was a kid again and I had to deal with something that had always bothered me and I killed a kid that had a heart attack. (The reason why the kid had a heart attack was because I had taken a drug that made the kid go crazy and then I killed the kid.) 

So, I think the dreams are telling you that you need to deal with something in your life that you have dealt with before in your life. It might be that you have been dealing with childhood friend stuff in your life, or it could be that you have done something bad in your life before.",0

"I'm not saying you're not bisexual. It's just that you don't feel that you are, and you're not sure.

I can understand. That's a rough road to go down. 

I would suggest to you that you make a conscious decision to be straight from now on, but do it because you're gay, not because you're straight. 

Think about what kind of person you want to be.

You want to be a role model for gay kids. 

But you are straight now. You can't be gay right now.

So be straight. 

You need to make that decision. 

If you're trying to figure out whether you're straight or gay, you're going to have to figure it out without the aid of any other people. 

If you want to be a role model for gay kids, think about what kind of person you want to be.",0
You're not bisexual. You're a little gay.,0
"you're not bisexual, so why are you asking the internet?",0
"Don't do it. There is a chance that you can become a homosexual if you sleep with a boy. 

You already know that you are attracted to men, nothing else. You will not become a homosexual if you sleep with a man. I know you want to try to change yourself, but if you try to be with a boy and do not want to be with a girl, you will not become a homosexual.",0
"I mean I really hope you do. But it seems to me like a better idea to try to make out with him (if you feel comfortable, of course). 

So try to kiss him, then feel him up or whatever and go from there. If you aren't into him, then you have to end things.",0
"I mean as long as it's safe and consensual, you're probably not going to get AIDS from kissing another dude.",0
This is a tricky one. It's hard to say. Some people will tell you you're gay. Some will tell you you're bisexual. You can't go between them. The best way you can tell for sure is to ask your crush.,0
"Don't feel bad about it, I had a crush on a girl and tried to kiss her but she brushed me off and I never heard from her again",0
I would not be in your situation if I was you so be the one in control of the situation.,0
">I know when I was in middle school I had a crush on a boy but I didn't act on it because I didn't know if I was straight or not.

This is pretty much the definition of being bisexual. You had those feelings but you didn't know if you were straight or not. Being bisexual is about exploring those feelings.

> The last time I kissed him I didn't know if I was gay or not. So now my question is should I try making out with my crush or maybe even have sex with him? I know I will feel terrible if I don't make a move but I feel like you should do what you feel.

Sexuality is way more than sexual attraction. The way you describe your situation sounds pretty much exactly like what a lot of people are dealing with. When I first started getting into BDSM & BDSM related topics, I came across a lot of misconceptions and assumptions. The only way to really learn about your own sexuality is to try it out. When you make out with your crush, be open with him about what you want. If he's receptive and receptive only. If he is not, try to not put much pressure on yourself.

If you really want to try and have sex with him, ask him to go down on you. If he's not interested in that, at least for your first time, you can explore that on your own.

For me, the key to being bi is to know that you are attracted to both genders & the idea of a romantic relationship with a gender other than your own.",0
"I think you should do what you want, even if it means being a little uncomfortable at first because we all have a lot to learn and to be completely honest, some people can't deal with the awkwardness. I know that feeling you just described and it can be so hard to find the right person for you.",0
"I'm not sure if you've read this post, but it's about a gay guy asking if he should try to talk to his straight crush because it might be better for him. I don't think there's a problem with you kissing your friend but I would recommend you talk to him first if you want to try to make out with him. I think it would be better to talk to him first because it's easier for straight guys to make out with girls and vice versa, and you can try to be more open with him as well.

Also, I have heard this many times before. I don't think it's good to keep in touch with your crush because he will probably start to feel like you're interested in him. I think you should try to get rid of him as quickly as possible so you don't have that problem. If you keep in touch with him maybe that will put pressure on you and you might lose your crush and find yourself in a place where you're not sure if you're gay or not. It's a fine line but I think you should be aware of that.

Hope it makes sense!",0
"I think if you've only started dating one person, your sexuality will be largely defined by that one person.  If you've only started dating one person...
I think that's a better idea.

But, I also think that you're way too new to be making assumptions.  You're 17.  It's not unusual to have your sexual orientation defined by one person for a while.  But if you hang out with your crush a lot or you guys have feelings for each other, then you're more likely to know.",0
"I would not do either. Even if you're not gay, that's the kind of behavior you might find acceptable. If you have a crush on a guy, then ask if he wants you to sleep with him.",0
"What if people are actually *alive* and have a sense of self, and they are actually in a simulation all along.",0

Ask them about their lives.,0
"I always take my time with my compliments, and always try and ask something along the lines of ""Do you like that dress?""

That usually gets them talking about themselves, and most of the time it works. When they do talk about themselves, it's usually something they know they've done wrong, like the last time I complimented my wife's legs, she freaked out like we were talking about her ex. I stopped talking about her in that way.",0
"When you ask them a question in a friendly and genuine way, you are asking them to share how they feel without any judgment. I'd be surprised if a woman has never been asked a question like that in her life, so just ask them.  

I find that women tend to be shy and uncomfortable sharing how they feel so it's usually more effective to have an open and honest discussion about it. A woman who's been in your life for a while is going to know what you're experiencing. For example, when I was in college, I'd sometimes be on a first name basis with a girl who was dating a guy I didn't know but she knew I was a good friend of hers and would always say hello. And I'd always give her a hug and be friendly. Once people are comfortable sharing their feelings and don't want to look insecure or like a stranger in a strange place, they are much more likely to share.",0

"I've had a look at this paper, and it's probably the most ambitious attempt to implement a neural language model, and I'm very interested in seeing what kind of improvements it could make!",0
"This is a great writeup, thanks for sharing. I'm curious, would this model actually work in the real world? Like, how would you set it up in your real-world applications? If there's any way to improve it, I'd love to know about it.

Also, I have a few follow-ups:

1. Why are recurrent neural networks more suited to language modeling tasks? Are recurrent neural networks really that suited to linguistic modeling?

2. Why did you choose the Deep RL model instead of the Deep RNN model?

3. If we could use recurrent neural networks for language modeling, is it possible to use the Deep RL model for language modeling in general? Maybe it's easier to use the Deep RL model for language modelling than the Deep RNN model, and it's easier to use the Deep RL model to perform language modeling.

4. How do you think the Deep RNN model compares to recurrent neural networks in terms of model complexity, and the amount of model parameters that need to be learned?

5. Do you think this model could be useful for machine translation?

6. How can we improve the Deep RL model, and how would you improve this model?

7. How would you change the Deep RL model to increase the amount of model parameters that need to be learned?",0
"I really appreciate you sharing your article. I am a huge fan of NLP and machine learning, and it really helps to know how things work, how to build a dataset for example.

So I have a couple questions for you:

1. How much data do you have for these two neural models and how many test cases do you have for each model (in terms of validation data)?
2. Do you have some kind of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, AUC?

Thanks a lot for sharing your knowledge!",0
Are you willing to do some kind of AMA ?,0
"One criticism that I've seen in these Neural language models is that they are not able to learn semantics. I think that this is not a big problem because there are a lot of languages that use a lot of words in their vocabulary and it is very difficult to classify how they are used.

For example, most of the words that you'd classify as the same word in any language are used in different languages. In some of these languages, they can be different words, but have different meanings.",0
"I have been trying to understand the difference between deep RL and deep NN. Deep RL seems like a lot of hyperparameters are tuned for good results, but don't really capture what it's trying to do, while deep NN seems to be a lot of hyperparameters are tuned for good results, but don't seem to capture what it's trying to do(reinforcement learning).",0

Is it ok with you that she has a few days of sex and you know she's in the mood, but you don't cum? Maybe you would prefer to have another day, and you're ok with her having one or two days to catch up.

Are you ok with her having 1 extra day of sex, or 4 extra days, but you know she's in the mood?

You nodded.   
The man looked at the number you had.   
You nodded again.   
""But the man on the other side of the table is a billionaire. He has a trillion dollars.   
You don't want to give him a million dollars, you want to give him a billion dollars.""   
""But if we do that, everyone on earth will die.   
So our second wish is to make a million billion people happy.

""So your fourth wish is to make him happy with a trillion billion billion people.""   
You nodded again.   
The man on the other side of the table raised his eyebrows.   
""That's the best you can do. Now you have to make him happy with a trillion billion billion people, and that's the biggest you can do.""   
""But we have to get the best deal we can,"" you said.   
The man on the other side of the table raised his eyebrows.   
""Do you have a hundred billion dollars, or do you just want to make him happy with a trillion billion billion people?""   
""I don't know, but I think we should make him happy with a trillion billion billion people,"" you said.   
""But you don't know!"" The man on the other side of the table said.   
You shook your head.   
The man on the other side of the table said, ""You've been here for only twenty minutes, and you already have a million dollars.   
You've been here for three hours, and you already have a billion dollars.   
And you keep getting better and better.   
So I don't know what to tell you.   
But I'll give you a hint.

""One million.""

I was shocked.

""I'm sorry, I can't do that I have a family,"" The first man said.

""But what if you do?"" I asked.

""It's not like you can help then,"" The second man said. ""All I want is to kill 1 million people. That's all I want.""

I was shocked again. I was speechless.

""I can't,"" The first man said. ""I want 1 million people to die.""

I was speechless. I have no words.

""I have no words,"" The first man said.

My mind was so full of nothing and nothing but nothing that I could never think of something.

""I won't kill one million people anymore,"" The other man said.

""Then we're good,"" I said.

""Then you're good,"" The first man said.

""I'm not,"" The other man said. ""I'm not good.""

""Then I'm not good either,"" The first man said.

""Nothing,"" The other man said. ""Nothing at all.""

""Why are you two sitting in silence?"" The first man asked.

"I have to agree with your first comment. I don't think MDMA is for everyone. It is very hard to tell the differences between ""a psych"" and ""an amphetamine"" because it is not metabolised so it doesn't have the same side effects. If one just takes a bunch of pills they will all have the same effects, but different side effects, and that is not an optimal mix. 

If you don't like it, then you don't like it. 

I like MDMA because it releases serotonin, which is known to calm down you. I don't want that to happen all the time, so I take it in small doses. That is also why it is harder to get pure MDMA, it is very rare. 

MDMA can be a party drug, but I prefer to do it in a more sober environment. I don't know why, it just works for me. 

I think an amphetamine is less likely to produce side effects like that, and can be taken to the extreme. 

I would say to try it, because there is no guarantee it will be ""good"". If you like it, then do it. If you don't like it, then don't do it.",0
"MDMA is the only one that works with a psychedelic mindset. I don't know what you're thinking when you say it doesn't work for you, but I feel like you're not completely right in your assessment.

First of all, I don't think MDMA is inherently more or less spiritual. I think there are aspects that can be better appreciated with a psychedelic mindset, and there are other aspects that can't be. When I trip on MDMA, I generally have a strong spiritual experience, but I also see a lot of other aspects of life that are in a very different place than they would be on a psychedelic trip.

I had a few friends who tried MDMA for the very first time and they said that it was the most spiritual experience they ever had. When you use MDMA, your subconscious is trying to get your attention. If you're on a psychedelic trip, your subconscious is trying to get you to go deeper.

When you use MDMA, your brain is trying to get out of the trance induced by the psychedelic experience. This can make you feel extremely uncomfortable and paranoid. This is a natural reaction to the drug.",0
"It's been said that ""MDMA is not for everyone."" I would recommend trying it with another psychedelics. I have had success with shrooms and marijuana, but have not had much success with LSD. But that's just because I haven't done it. I haven't tried psychedelics that much, but I will most likely pick up a tab of whatever I buy this summer. MDMA is not for everyone. I hope it helps.",0
"It's a hard drug to get to know, a lot of people find the roll to be overwhelming. Personally, I find MDMA to be quite relaxing, and at a very basic level, you're rolling your body off.

At the most basic level, it's an amphetamine that's a lot more euphoric than it is stimulating.

You're probably feeling like shit and you need to take some time to figure out what the hell's going on. I wouldn't consider it anything like LSD or shrooms, and I'd say it's more like a psychedelic that can make you feel a bit more down on yourself than LSD, which is more like shrooms.

As such, it's probably not for you.",0
"I would say MDMA is most definitely not a good trip for your first time. I have a friend who took it his first time and said that he felt terrible. I've never tried it, but everyone that I've talked to says the same. The only way you will feel ""normal"" is through a lot of experience with it. I would say you should start with a low dose and wait 8-10 hours before taking it again. That should give you a good taste of the ""bad"" side of it. If you want to take a higher dose, wait up to 24 hours but only take one dose. The reason why you shouldn't take a higher dose is because the high itself can be overwhelming. 

I wish you luck, I can only recommend to take it with people you know that you trust. I think you will have a great time and you will be able to have meaningful conversations with your friends and have a really great time that you won't remember for a long time after your first time.",0
"I've found that mushrooms and shrooms are very similar but you'll have a much easier time with shrooms because of the nausea. The high is very similar as well. The two are also very similar so you can feel the effects of either one at a much quicker rate.

On the other hand you'll have a much stonger ride on MDMA. I mean you'll have a great time at least. But you'll have an extremely difficult time, much harder than shrooms.

You'll likely have the most intense and beautiful experience either on shrooms, or molly, but it will be the most difficult to enjoy it.

So if you're looking for something very intense and very intense, but you'll have a good time on each, and you wouldn't mind the nausea, mushrooms may be a better fit for you.

If you're looking for something very subtle, and easy to enjoy on a lower dose, I may suggest LSD instead. 

I personally think MDMA can be a very nice and nice to have experience, but it's not a good drug to use everyday.",0
"Don't take MDMA if you have depression or suicidal thoughts. That's the only thing I can think of, but you're only 19 so I'm pretty sure you'll be fine.",0

In the second round, Wonder Twins would be in the same range as the first round but Goku could use stuff from his own manga, I don't know what the Wonder Twins' power levels are but even with Superman's power levels, Goku should be able to pull off the Wonder Twins, especially since Superman and Goku are in character.

Finally, in round three, the Wonder Twins would probably be at the same power level as the Wonder Twins in their own series, but Goku should still be able to put them down or even take them out.",0

You don't even have a relationship yet so it's a bit strange to make such a big deal out of this. If she doesn't like you then you're not the one for her. If you're not the one for her then you're not the one for her.

>I have no idea how to get a girl to want to go out with me, and I would like some advice from men who have been in this situation. 

What you want is to find a girl who wants to go out with you because you're hot and they're hot. Then you can go out and get laid until you die.

>I haven't had a girlfriend.

I mean, yeah, you haven't had a relationship. But it's not like you've never had girlfriends. You've got lots of experience and a lot of money and a lot of hobbies, you haven't really had any issues.

"The husband was involved in the woman's disappearance as well. And I'm sorry but it's just a case of ""the husband was a drug addict and the woman was a prostitute""",0
"If the husband is not a suspect in the woman's disappearance, who is?",0
"In the UK, it's quite common to know your missing relative or friend's name, and some of the time some of the details can still be found online. This is the case in the case of this ""missing woman"".

However it really depends on the circumstances, there are a lot of reasons for a family not to report their loved one missing, but they would rather try to keep the family together in some way.

It's not really a case of missing people, missing people are generally kept in the family. 

It's a case of missing person, there isn't really a missing person. The family had a reason to not report the woman missing, but I can't really say what it was. 

The family knows the missing person is dead, you have no idea when. 

Your family has a reason to not report the missing person missing, even if you don't realise it. 

I can't really say what the missing person's son did, but if he was a drug user, then the death of the person was accidental. 

But to jump straight to the end, it's probably no where near what you're looking for, I would say most people wouldn't want to report their loved one missing if they've been missing for a long time.",0
"My thoughts:

1. It's been a few years, so I don't think there is a lot to do with the husband being involved in the woman's disappearance. Maybe he could have been involved, but I don't think that they knew it was him. 

2. I think the police missed a few chances to solve the case. The family doesn't seem to be in the best of health (I mean, if they could still be alive, they could have done more to find the man) and the police are understaffed. I think it's possible they could have saved the woman's life by not pursuing the husband's theories. 

3. It seems like they had a real problem with drugs in the area at the time. As a former police officer who worked around London, I think there's a high chance that the wife was going to get sick and die. The drug scene in London is pretty dangerous and there are lots of places to hide drugs. I could see the police looking into this further, but I think it's going to be much harder with a dead woman and her husband. 

4. I think the ""husband"" was someone who was out to kill her. He got out of prison a few years ago, and when the time came, he decided he was going to take out his revenge. The fact that she was a victim of domestic violence makes this seem much more likely.

5. I think the husband did something to lead to the woman's death. He got really drunk, and I think he was so drunk he blacked out. The husband is definitely responsible for his wife's death, but I think he also had a history of violence toward her. 

6. The police should have done more to find the wife. It's a crime scene, and not a lot of people go in after dark without a good idea of what might be there.",0

"Dear Senator Graham,

We have an important update regarding the current state of food and agriculture in the United States.

First and foremost, I'd like to say that we are deeply saddened by your passing, as you were the only Senator to vote against allowing genetically modified foods to be labeled. While this vote was ultimately a mistake on your part, it was not at all your fault. While we were initially going to try to work with you on the labeling issue, it would have been counterproductive to try to work with you on the issue if you were to be an issue.

So, here is to you, a Senator on the wrong side of history that only needed a little push to start being an issue.

To continue, I'd like to give you a bit of a summary of what happened during the last 48 hours in the United States, so that you will know what to expect next time.

You seem to have been involved in a huge battle with the agricultural community, in which a group of farmers attempted to force a recall of crops from your local grocery store. The recall was ultimately voted down by the voters, but not by a huge margin. If you had not pushed the recall vote through at the last minute, then the farmers would have succeeded.

The recall attempt was made by a group of farmers, who were concerned that the genetically modified products that had been grown with Monsanto's ""Roundup Ready"" traits were causing harm to their crops.

There is a massive backlash against Monsanto, as this was the worst thing the company had ever tried to pull off, and the people who were involved in the recall efforts felt that the farmers should have the choice in what crops they were growing.

Monsanto then hired a large number of lobbyists to try to get the issue off the table for the time being. This effort failed, and it was only a matter of time before the issue would come to a head, and the people who were involved in the recall attempt would receive a fair amount of backlash from the public.

Monsanto, of course, responded with a campaign of their own, one that called for a boycott of any foods that did not contain the genetically modified trait. The company also spent a lot of money trying to get the issue off the table, which they most certainly did.

The issue was brought to the attention of the public again when one of the farmers who were in a fight with Monsanto killed himself.

The government was contacted about this, however, and so they sent a team of researchers out to visit the farm where this farmer killed himself. They were able to confirm the farmer's death, and they were able to find out exactly who the farmer was. This information was then given to the general public.

This was the most recent news in this issue, and there will probably be more updates until the issue is resolved.

In the mean time, the GMO labeling issue continues to be an issue. The people who were involved in the recall effort have been arrested, and the government is looking into the possibility of a murder charge.

Also, while we did not get the food recall bill passed, it was passed by the House of Representatives, and is now being considered by the Senate.

Sincerely,

The FDA",0

"Hello,
I’d like to converse with you guys to see if there’s any angles on this topic that has eluded me. The idea behind goals has often enthralled me (ever since I moved out to begin my adult life) and it’s hard to grasp why so many people don’t follow through or, on occasion, make no attempt to achieve their goals. I know nihilists could argue that making goals is irrelevant, seeing as they view life as meaningless but let’s take a view from the general consensus that making good goals (hence you give life meaning due to the fact you’re basically giving yourself a purpose) is the viewpoint for this topic. Back to the discussion at hand....I often find people that neglect their duties, whether it’s something simple e.g taking out the trash or something that is more difficult (but achievable) like studying for a final exam. They know it’s important , beneficial to themself as well as other people (exams lead to further education-higher performance for jobs-economy...I’d love to discuss the importance of education on a different thread😋) but yet, they choose not to because they, “don’t feel like it”. Now consider this, why don’t we “feel like it”? If we can think of the bigger picture and ultimately value what completing tasks brings us in life, why do we insist on using our time on things that bring us no productivity? Because there’s more entertaining things to do perhaps? The world we live in now is full of “distractions” via advertisements and the internet but this isn’t a valid reason why we would choose to spend our time invested in the present rather than the future (I’m sure most would agree that building the future would take priority over indulging oneself in the present pleasures). This is where my quandary becomes evident, even though people know what they should be doing and can discern the correct path on which they must take to becoming “successful”....they simply choose not to. Perhaps I’m leaning too closely to philosophy; I’m aware, as humans, we formulate a lot of our decisions on how we feel (and for good reason, personal taste is one’s own style and variety is what makes people interesting...and obviously having affections towards someone or enjoying the work you do attributes to one’s “purpose”) but I’m just having a difficult time comprehending why so many people don’t achieve what they want in life when they’re perfectly capable of doing so.",1

We're actually on the same team at work, which gives us access to see each other's performance stats and she's doing absolute shit in every way possible. 

I did her a solid by never saying anything to her family and listening along/asking questions when she spoke highly of herself at a recent (socially distanced) family gathering. She told everyone that she was on-route for a promotion and I just congratulated her and asked her if she could tell me some tips.

For a little while, at least, you need to get your shit together and listen to this tape. It is very relevant to your situation. I’m going to tell you, in detail, why you have been kidnapped, what’s going to happen to you and how long you’ll be here.

It's not a joke and was played to his many victims.  The rest of the tape gets steadily worse.",1

Again, they don't actually melt - it's just an analogy for the magnetic behavior of the material.",1

Some older relatives-in-law will literally walk past my husband in a really rude way just so they can perform antiquated sexist ""chivalry"" by shaking my hand first.

"What's funny is that pretty much all these people who believe this conspiracy theory are already carrying a tracking device on their person, their cell phone. It's even got a microphone so it can record everything they say.",1
"[The Psychology of Conspiracy Theories: Why Do People Believe Them?](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-psychology-of-conspiracy-theories-why-do-people-believe-them/)  
>**Conspiracy Theories Are Driven by People, Not Facts**
>
You can’t really argue with people who believe in conspiracy theories, because their beliefs aren’t rational. Instead, they are often fear- or paranoia-based beliefs that, when confronted with contrarian factual evidence, will dismiss both the evidence and the messenger who brings it. That’s because conspiracy theories are driven by the people who believe and spread them and their own psychological makeup — not on the factual support or logical reasoning of the theory itself.",1

It was the last day of class in mechanics before finals and we missed the last half of it thanks to a fire drill,1
You guys have drills,1
"Teacher here. My school - a year ago - had the silent alarm triggered. The unannounced silent alarm is a code 3: meaning shelter in place, INTERNAL threat. We don’t do drills with students for this. 
Protocol was to hide all visibility and use all means necessary to hide students and protect them. I hid all of my students and told them stories from my childhood to keep them calm and distracted. I even took students in from the street to keep them safe too.  For all I knew, there was a school shooter on campus. The adrenaline rush was crazy. 

Turns out it was a false alarm triggered by an admin. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️",1
At my highschool we all had to gather on the football field. It's not a bad thing but the field is more dirt than grass and that the staff always think the day after it rains/snow is the best day  to have fire drills,1
They let off the fire drill even though it was an attempted bombing. The worst part was we saw the police pull up outside our school before the alarm went off. It also went off 10 minutes before the end of the school day and instead of letting us leave they made us wait on our astro pitch for an hour while they search the school,1

Masks. Masks are going to go from a gated symbol of “oppression” to a requirement to an ironic statement to a fashion accessory to a necessary piece of clothing (no shirt no shoes no mask no service)

Furries. Don’t hurt me. Furries are shunned now, but according to the cycle of internet popularity that could very well change. There are already plenty of furries in communities all over. A considerable portion of the non-furries are doing it ironically, their ringleader being theodd1sout. Eventually it will go from ironic to popular as society becomes more and more artificial. I’m just enough furry that I would go along with it, but never right now. Never.",1

"Oil is viscous and sticky, and our skin is covered with ridges etc so the oil stays in them pretty well. 

Oil is hydrophobic meaning it repels water, like water bounces off oil and vice versa. They don't mix easily as you quite rightly say. 

Soap exploits the hydrophobic qualities of oil. What this means is that soap has two sides, one that loves water and one that hates water. So the soap forms rings around the oil and moves it away.",1
"Oil's density has nothing to do with why it doesn't wash off.  
Oil doesn't stick to water, that's why it forms a layer on top of the water by itself.  
So if you run your oily hands through water, the oil doesn't stick to the water, but it's still stuck to your hands.  
  
Soap is stuff that sticks to both water and oil, it's why we use it.  
So the soap sticks to the dirt, then it sticks to the water, and it pulls the dirt off your hands.",1

Also, I didn’t have a license nor how to mix drinks. And I would have to take a cab home late at night. No disrespect meant for bartenders, I was not a good fit for the job.

A couple of weeks later, my father has set me up for an interview. I go to it, expecting it was for a clerical position. Nope. It was for a bartender.

Tea for the taste,1
I drink it for the pain.,1
"tea is always for taste first because it has lower caffeine content, but different teas can give a decent kick if you want that.

coffee is half about taste and half about caffeine. i MIGHT do like a decaf espresso if i'm out with people late at night and want something fancier than water or herbal tea, but that's not really my go-to.

if i just need straight caffeine, i'll do something like a starbucks americano black w/ added shots of espresso and/or 5 hour energy type stuff. repeat as needed depending on how shitty you think your day will be and how much you need the goddess caffeina to pull you through.",1
"I really like coffee with cream absolutely nice (for the taste). I use to drink it stronger (with less milk) before workouts when I felt dull, the caffeine got me going",1

They don’t use common sense or reason. They just want to fill the void they feel by being childless since feminism tells them they can’t be mothers or they are lesser beings. The ones that do have kids raise their sons to be fucking effeminate beta cucks. It is time to take women’s rights away and kick these fucking invaders out. 

You can call me a racist all you want or use whatever shaming language you want because I don’t give a fuck. These words have no power over me.
