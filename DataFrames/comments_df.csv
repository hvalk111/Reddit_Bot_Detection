"Don't worry about how to defend a queen attack. It is completely normal to be down pieces when your opponent has a queen and there is nothing you can do to stop it. 

You also need to remember that queens are not only a problem when they attack d3, but also when they attack your pawns.

As for what to do with the white king, it also depends on where the king is on the board. If you are in the d file with the black queen, I would probably keep your king on d file and try to castle. The white queen on b5 is not a problem since you still have your pawns protecting your king.

If the white queen attacks your king, you then have a number of options:

1. If you are already in the king's corner try to trade queens on the next turn and make your king the only one in the king's corner.

2. Take the white queen with your king.

3. Try to push your king out diagonally so that the white knight can get to that position.

4. Send your queen to a better place. For example, after you take the white queen, you can attack the black king (if it is white) with your queen.

You can also play:

5.Pawn to d1, push e1 knight into the enemy king.

If you are not in the kings corner, you can also get queenside pawns to get them in the kingside corner and protect your king.",0

"I don't think the Federation would have gone to war with the Klingons.  The Federation wouldn't have been at peace with them, and they would absolutely have been at war with them.

In fact, I'd say that the Federation would have been at war with the Klingons, and then went to peace with them.

Consider, for a moment, a scenario where the Federation never made peace with the Klingons, because they were at war with them.  This is what the Dominion did.

Imagine the Federation never made peace with them, because they were at war with them.  That's what the Dominion did.

But the Federation doesn't make peace with the Klingons, because they are at war with them.  So there is a conflict between what the Federation *is* and what it *should* be.  The Federation *is* peace with them, because they *should* be peace with them, but they *are* at war with them, and what they *should* be peace with them is war with them.

I don't think the Federation would have gone to war with the Klingons.",0
"I think we can also add the Klingon occupation of the Federation to this. 

It was likely not that the Federation was at war with the Klingons (it was clearly not having as much of a war with the Klingons as it was with the Romulans... which is to say a bit), but that the Federation was not at war with both the Klingons and the Romulans.",0

"No, just no.

First of all, the Klingon Empire existed in the 23rd and 24th century. It's a little bit later than TOS, and TMP, but it's definitely post TOS.

Secondly, the Federation had a war with the Romulans just as bad, and as far as we know, there wasn't as much to be gained by a war with the Klingons. The Federation is not the Federation of today.

Thirdly, the Klingons are not very technologically advanced, and their warp drive is not that great either, so the Federation would have been a lot more powerful in comparison.

Fourthly, even if the Federation did have a war with the Klingons, it would be a pretty long war, and would most likely end with the Klingons and their Romulan allies being at least in a sort of stalemate, because of the Klingons' technological superiority and their unwillingness to fight the Federation.",0

"I'd say that any film that tries to follow the structure of other films of the same genre is bound to fail.  

There are only so many ways to end a movie, and it's more effective to use the conventions of the genre in your analysis.

The first movie you watch is going to be the one that most people will go to see for the first time in the theater.  The second movie is going to be the best one to watch with a partner.  The third movie is going to be the best in the theater, but it's also going to be the most complicated to watch.

I mean, I understand why a movie like *The Departed* works, but I don't know why it did that, or what I can learn from it.

>George Washington Caro was the only member of the New York Provincial Congress (1770) to live past the age of thirty. But he didn't get to enjoy the spoils of retirement. He was killed by an Indian in 1774. The cause of this unfortunate accident was a misunderstanding between the two men. Washington Caro took his horse to Buffalo to hunt buffalo and ended up killing an Indian who was hunting buffalo with an Indian. The Indian who killed Washington Caro claimed he did so in self-defense.

>The Indian who had killed Washington Caro was killed in a similar way, but it was accepted that Washington Caro's horse would have killed the Indian, and, in any case, George Washington Caro was not the one who killed the Indian. His brother's son, Alexander Caro, claimed that he was the one who killed Washington Caro in his own defense.

You could use z^2/4 = z^2 - 3 and it would still be not a valid function. So I guess z^2/4 = 1 can't be used.

In the case of f(x) = z^2/4 + 3, it's a little easier. You can rewrite the function f(x) = z/4 + 3 as f(x) = 1/x, which is what you want. That's why z/4 + 3 is the same as z + 3.

If you want to know the value of any function, you have to do a bit of work. You need to know how many terms you have in a series and how many terms you have in a fraction. After you've done this, you can use the formula to determine the value of the function.

So, to simplify your problem, you need to find the value of the function f(z) = x^2/4 + 3.

You can find out how much value you have by doing the same thing as you did above. I would take f(x) = z^2/4 + 3 and find z = 1/x, which will give you z = 1.

In the case of f(x) = z^2/4 + 3, you can find out how much value you have by doing the same as you did above. I would take f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 and find z = 1/z, which will give you z = 2.",0

"1) You can think of the derivative as:

f(z) - (z-2)(z-2) = (z-2)(z-2) - (z-2)(z-2) = f(z)

For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2/4 + 3 is

f(x) - (x-2)(x-2) = (x-2)(x-2) - (x-2)(x-2) = (x-2)(x-2) - (x-2)(x-2) = f(x)

2) You can think of the derivative of f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 as

f(z) - (z-2)(z-2) = -z^2/4 + 3

For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2/4 + 3 is

f(x) - (x-2)(x-2) = -2x^2/4 + 3

3) You can think of the derivative of f(z) = z^2/4 + 3 as

f(z) - (z-2)(z-2) = -2z^2/4 + 3

For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2/4 + 3 is

f(x) - (x-2)(x-2) = -2z^2/4 + 3

So basically, we can think of the derivative of a function f(z) as f(z-2)(z-2)/2 + (z-2)(z-2)/2 - (z-2)(z-2)/2 = (z-2)(z-2)/2 - (z-2)(z-2)/2 = f(z-2)(z-2)",0

"Well as it turns out, the Klingons have a concept of ""pratium"" which basically means learning through experience, and the Klingons have a lot of experience with warfare and warfare tactics in general.

So, if we're going to pretend that the K'darid have a similar philosophy, then their method of teaching Klingon is probably a bit different.

K'Tara: ""We do not teach the Klingon warrior to read, write, or even to count. We only teach him to fight.""

K'Tara: ""If you want to know how we teach our warriors, it is by fighting.""

K'Tara's point is that a warrior who is not fighting will not know the significance of what he's doing and will not have any effect on the larger Klingon society, so we need to start young.

So, there you have it: Klingon children are taught by their elders, and there is a lot of combat training in Klingon society that includes an emphasis on fighting.

That's not to say that Klingon society isn't also taught about technology and science (e.g. during childhood), or that Klingon society doesn't have a very strong influence on a younger Klingon's behavior (e.g. the Klingon ""pratizh"", or the Klingon ""fight or flight"" response).

But yes, Klingons tend to be very focused on combat, and it's not an accident that Klingons who have been raised in Klingon society frequently show this focus on combat, as a result of the K'darid Klingon concept of ""pratium"".",0
"I think a lot of it has to do with the person's ability to form their own opinions and opinions based on what other people think.

As a result, there are a lot of Klingons that have heard the Klingons are ruthless and do not like them, but the Klingon Empire still lives on. A Klingon who has been to Klingon Academy can go from zero knowledge to all knowledge in a very short amount of time.

The Klingon Empire thrives because of the Klingons and the Klingons make the Empire thrive.

A Klingon with the Klingon language and culture and language memorization, but no knowledge of Klingon culture and language can never have the knowledge to be part of the Klingon Empire. It has been passed down by word of mouth from the mother to the child.

That is why the Klingon Empire is so strong.",0

"Well, if you're talking about, say, history, that's usually the result of education. If you're talking about current events, that's usually the result of a few key things happening.

* First, a well-informed person is likely to be well-informed about current events. Someone who knows a lot about the Middle Ages is unlikely to be aware of all the current events which are in the Middle Ages.
* Second, a well-informed person is likely to know what people who are well-informed about current events are likely to be aware of. If I don't know what is going on in the Middle Ages, I'm not likely to know what is going on in the world today. It's quite difficult to avoid being aware of current events in all their aspects; if you don't know what's happening in the Middle Ages, you'll be unaware of all the events happening in the Middle Ages.

A simple example is that if a well-informed person knows that the Middle Ages are over, they tend to know that the Middle Ages are over and that the Middle Ages are over and probably also have some ideas about what's going on in the world today (the Middle Ages are over, the Middle Ages are over, the Middle Ages are over).

On top of that, the well-informed person is likely to be well-informed about current events.

"It's not easy. The first step is to give the person a reason to learn. If you're just taking the kid to work or to school, this is easier. If you make them watch documentaries or read a book, you still need to have some kind of introduction to the subject. Then, you give them a lot of material to digest. That can be a good way to make someone ""get"" something because it's so new and surprising. Then, you have to explain all the ways in which it's different to other ways of doing things, but still similar enough that the learner can figure out why. That's when the real learning starts.

The next step is to make the learner feel smart. That means making sure it's interesting and informative and that the learner is interested. That includes making sure they have some idea of what they're supposed to do, what their purpose is, and what to do exactly. If a kid is just learning about the moon landing and asks you about it, there's really not much you have to do with him.

I think it's likely, yes, but I do not think it's ""likely""

The singularity is a very good description of what's going to happen, and it's very likely. It's more likely than a lot of other things that are called 'deterministic'.",0
"The singularity is not a single event, it is the most likely outcome of exponential technological growth.  You can see the technological growth of the past 50 years in the last 100 years in the next 50.

The singularity does not have a point where it just stops.  It goes on indefinitely.  And it is not linear.

The singularity is a continuous process.  It is exponential, like exponential growth.

That being said, there are many predictions of what the singularity will be.  From AGI, to post-singularity, to FTL travel.  A few of them are not unrealistic.  I like the Singularity Institute predictions, but they are not realistic all the time.",0

"I've been thinking about it too. I'm not really sure. I think it's possible, but I think we're not going to see it for a long time. I think the current rate of technological change (we're only really just starting to see major changes that will be seen for decades before the singularity) is about a billion times faster than it would have been in 2000 (though that was a time of tremendous change, too).

To me, the singularity is sort of the end of the human race, and the next time we see a big technological shift probably won't be for about 200,000 years. If we reach AGI or ASI, it will be a lot like the invention of the computer. We'll see the computers that are smarter than us. Then we can just go a billion times smarter than us. That will probably happen about 10 years after we reach AGI or ASI.

"I'm going to go with a conventional war. The Klingons are probably a little more intelligent than the Federation, and I don't see the Federation having the resources to wage an all out war. Their military might, once they've got the Federation on the back foot would be very hard to overcome. They would have the resources to do it, but the Federation has a very, very good chance of winning.",0
"I imagine that in the event of a Klingon-Federation conflict, they would fight a conventional war.  I agree it would be difficult to go to war with the Klingons without risking some kind of genocide of both sides.

As for the Klingons, I presume they would try to fight back, but they would probably become more and more desperate as the war progressed.  They'd probably become even more isolationist, and would do their best to avoid the Federation, but only in the event that they were forced to.  I imagine that they would, at some point, try to enter the war with a preemptive attack.  If that failed, they would try to negotiate and reach some kind of agreement that would put their entire people in a better position.  They probably would not have any way to do this, so it probably wouldn't be worth the risk.

I imagine that if the two sides were in full-scale war, then the Federation would continue to support the Klingons in some way.  Eventually, they would probably turn to their only real ally, the Romulans, and rely on them to help them fight the Klingons.  I imagine that Romulans and Klingons would get along well, and the Romulans would use the Klingons as cannon fodder.

I can't imagine the Klingons ever joining the Federation, because one, I don't think they ever had the ability to do so.  Two, I don't think they would be able to survive an invasion of the Klingon Empire.  The Federation would be able to provide them with plenty of supplies, and would probably be able to provide them with advanced technology.",0
"The Federation doesn't have a standing army. As far as I'm aware, Starfleet only has a small number of ships and is mainly composed of ships from civilian space (although that number has been increased recently). They have several outposts in Klingon space but even if the Klingons were aggressive, I doubt they have the capacity to carry out an invasion of Federation space. 

The Klingons had a treaty with the Federation, but I'm not sure if it was violated. Since they never signed a peace treaty, I'm not sure how or when the Klingon Empire could have broken the treaty. Klingon ships are not equipped for long range travel and Starfleet has no way of stopping the Klingons from sending in ships from Klingon space.",0
What I think the Federation would do is go to war with the Klingons by using their own technology to disable their ships. I think the Federation would just start off with that approach to defeat the Klingons.,0
"There are many different possible outcomes to a war, and all of them are not good. It's really up to our imagination, and whether we want to risk the lives of our loved ones to stop the enemy from doing whatever it is that we don't like, or whether we want to risk a conventional war and destroy the enemy's ability to do what it wants, and kill our loved ones in the process.",0
It depends on who you were talking to.  I'd say that the Federation would almost certainly go to war with the Klingons but not by overwhelming force as a preemptive strike would lead to a war with the Klingons and a war with the Federation would result in the Klingons losing that war.  The Federation would do all of their research to find out who the Klingons were and destroy them from the get go.,0

When you have a goal set up, take a few minutes and decide on what you will do when you get there. 

Plan things as you go. 

When you have been working for a while, try to go to bed a bit earlier. 

When you have taken a few days off, take a few days off. 

When you have taken a few weeks off, go to sleep earlier. 

If you are stuck in a rut, don't beat yourself up. 

Don't stress because you are too lazy to get out of bed. 

Don't get stressed because of something outside of your control. 

It is possible to make changes and do things when you are bored. 

Be patient.

"It's hard to train for the first 3-4 months (as you do more than you should).  That being said, the first 3-4 months are going to be a grind.  You know you want to do it, but you're still trying to get in shape, so you just can't focus fully on it.  It's going to be a long slog, so plan your workouts as best as you can.  Start with your main lifts (deadlifts/squats/bench press/ohp) and build up to them.  Also, do more than what you need to, but maybe the next time you do it, do more than you're doing now.

My recommendation if you're new to lifting is to start with the weight you need to lift at a higher weight.  If after a month or so, you're still not making progress, then start a program like 5/3/1 with one or two additional sets at a lower weight.  Your form will be better because you're working hard, and you'll be able to continue to increase your weight and you'll have more time to work on things you need.",0
"Well the thing is for most beginner programs, you need to be able to follow a workout plan and not have to worry too much about what you are doing wrong, the amount of weight you can complete and the right exercises. 

If you are really new to weights, you should definitely try the beginner program I mentioned. You can always read some info on the website or on the FAQ, but there's a lot of information out there to help you get started. 

In the beginner program, you always start with the basics. I would start with the bench press, biceps, legs, arms (pushups, handstand pushups, crunches, etc.), cardio, core etc.

Once you are doing some of those basic exercises, you can start working in your own stuff and work on your own stuff. 

The beginner program does have a few advanced workouts which I assume you're still trying to work into your routine. These are some of them:

1) Deadlift
2) Squat
3) Shoulder Press
4) Military Press
5) Pushups
6) Handstand Pushups
7) Crunches
8) Ab exercises

Once you have done all of those, you can start moving on to the more advanced workouts. 

For example, if you're still struggling with the pushups, I would recommend to start doing them with dumbells. If you're not able to do the pushups, just do 2 sets of 3 pushups. After you've done those, you can start doing other ab exercises like sit-ups, crunches etc. This will allow you to work on those muscles. 

When it comes to the program, the only things that you really need to worry about is the exercises and the total volume of the program. The rest is just for extra motivation and variety. 

The only thing that I think you need to do is the warm up sets because I don't know if you can do your warm up sets with a dumbbell. You can't really warm up with your hands so I would recommend using a barbell.",0

Are you depressed or something?,0
I dreamt about dying 2 nights ago too. I got run over by a car while walking my dog. I almost died and now I am in another world where I don't know where I am. I have been having dreams like this for years but now they are more realistic.,0
I have had dreams of dying very similar to this. I'm not sure if they mean anything. It's just really weird.,0
"For some people, the way they die is often linked to the way they die in the future. That's why, for example, people who are religious will often have dreams of dying by being tortured in hell, or people who are pessimistic will often have dreams of dying by being crushed or burned alive.

However, it's important to remember that dreams are usually more symbolic than literal. I think it would be more likely, if you were actually dying, you'd have a much more emotional reaction in your dreams. I think it's a good sign that you're able to recognize your dream symbolism, but more importantly, I think it's important to remember that dreams are a way of processing all of the things in your life that you want to express to yourself, and sometimes they seem to go a bit overboard.",0
"You have to figure out if you are worried about something in your life or if you are worried about the possibility of losing your loved ones. I would recommend writing down the major dreams you had and see if you can come up with anything specific. Then, use a dream dictionary to see if there are certain words or ideas that have meaning.",0
"There are many ways to interpret these dreams.  The first thing is if you are feeling lost in the world or if you are feeling disconnected from the people who matter to you.  To me, that sounds like a sense of selflessness or a loss of connection to those around you.  In your dreams, you are trying to find or reconnect with that sense of selflessness.  To find it means to be open to others and to understand that the people you know and love are people you are not connected to.  You are looking for it in other people, because it is a feeling that cannot be found in yourself.",0
"I think the dreams are telling you that you are still trying to deal with something that you haven't dealt with yet. Like the first dream I have had has involved my childhood friend (also a childhood friend) I killed her. I had to live with the guilt of it for a long time and it just came out in the dream. 

In the second dream I had I was a kid again and I had to deal with something that had always bothered me and I killed a kid that had a heart attack. (The reason why the kid had a heart attack was because I had taken a drug that made the kid go crazy and then I killed the kid.) 

So, I think the dreams are telling you that you need to deal with something in your life that you have dealt with before in your life. It might be that you have been dealing with childhood friend stuff in your life, or it could be that you have done something bad in your life before.",0

Think about what kind of person you want to be.

You want to be a role model for gay kids. 

But you are straight now. You can't be gay right now.

So be straight. 

You need to make that decision.

">I know when I was in middle school I had a crush on a boy but I didn't act on it because I didn't know if I was straight or not.

This is pretty much the definition of being bisexual. You had those feelings but you didn't know if you were straight or not. Being bisexual is about exploring those feelings.

> The last time I kissed him I didn't know if I was gay or not. So now my question is should I try making out with my crush or maybe even have sex with him? I know I will feel terrible if I don't make a move but I feel like you should do what you feel.

Sexuality is way more than sexual attraction. The way you describe your situation sounds pretty much exactly like what a lot of people are dealing with. When I first started getting into BDSM & BDSM related topics, I came across a lot of misconceptions and assumptions. The only way to really learn about your own sexuality is to try it out. When you make out with your crush, be open with him about what you want. If he's receptive and receptive only. If he is not, try to not put much pressure on yourself.

If you really want to try and have sex with him, ask him to go down on you. If he's not interested in that, at least for your first time, you can explore that on your own.

For me, the key to being bi is to know that you are attracted to both genders & the idea of a romantic relationship with a gender other than your own.",0
"I think you should do what you want, even if it means being a little uncomfortable at first because we all have a lot to learn and to be completely honest, some people can't deal with the awkwardness. I know that feeling you just described and it can be so hard to find the right person for you.",0
"I'm not sure if you've read this post, but it's about a gay guy asking if he should try to talk to his straight crush because it might be better for him. I don't think there's a problem with you kissing your friend but I would recommend you talk to him first if you want to try to make out with him. I think it would be better to talk to him first because it's easier for straight guys to make out with girls and vice versa, and you can try to be more open with him as well.

Also, I have heard this many times before. I don't think it's good to keep in touch with your crush because he will probably start to feel like you're interested in him. I think you should try to get rid of him as quickly as possible so you don't have that problem. If you keep in touch with him maybe that will put pressure on you and you might lose your crush and find yourself in a place where you're not sure if you're gay or not. It's a fine line but I think you should be aware of that.

Hope it makes sense!",0
"I think if you've only started dating one person, your sexuality will be largely defined by that one person.  If you've only started dating one person...
I think that's a better idea.

But, I also think that you're way too new to be making assumptions.  You're 17.  It's not unusual to have your sexual orientation defined by one person for a while.  But if you hang out with your crush a lot or you guys have feelings for each other, then you're more likely to know.",0

"When you ask them a question in a friendly and genuine way, you are asking them to share how they feel without any judgment. I'd be surprised if a woman has never been asked a question like that in her life, so just ask them.  

I find that women tend to be shy and uncomfortable sharing how they feel so it's usually more effective to have an open and honest discussion about it. A woman who's been in your life for a while is going to know what you're experiencing. For example, when I was in college, I'd sometimes be on a first name basis with a girl who was dating a guy I didn't know but she knew I was a good friend of hers and would always say hello. And I'd always give her a hug and be friendly.

"This is a great writeup, thanks for sharing. I'm curious, would this model actually work in the real world? Like, how would you set it up in your real-world applications? If there's any way to improve it, I'd love to know about it.

Also, I have a few follow-ups:

1. Why are recurrent neural networks more suited to language modeling tasks? Are recurrent neural networks really that suited to linguistic modeling?

2. Why did you choose the Deep RL model instead of the Deep RNN model?

3. If we could use recurrent neural networks for language modeling, is it possible to use the Deep RL model for language modeling in general? Maybe it's easier to use the Deep RL model for language modelling than the Deep RNN model, and it's easier to use the Deep RL model to perform language modeling.

4. How do you think the Deep RNN model compares to recurrent neural networks in terms of model complexity, and the amount of model parameters that need to be learned?

5. Do you think this model could be useful for machine translation?

6. How can we improve the Deep RL model, and how would you improve this model?

7. How would you change the Deep RL model to increase the amount of model parameters that need to be learned?",0
"I really appreciate you sharing your article. I am a huge fan of NLP and machine learning, and it really helps to know how things work, how to build a dataset for example.

So I have a couple questions for you:

1. How much data do you have for these two neural models and how many test cases do you have for each model (in terms of validation data)?
2. Do you have some kind of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, AUC?

Thanks a lot for sharing your knowledge!",0
Are you willing to do some kind of AMA ?,0
"One criticism that I've seen in these Neural language models is that they are not able to learn semantics. I think that this is not a big problem because there are a lot of languages that use a lot of words in their vocabulary and it is very difficult to classify how they are used.

For example, most of the words that you'd classify as the same word in any language are used in different languages. In some of these languages, they can be different words, but have different meanings.",0
"I have been trying to understand the difference between deep RL and deep NN. Deep RL seems like a lot of hyperparameters are tuned for good results, but don't really capture what it's trying to do, while deep NN seems to be a lot of hyperparameters are tuned for good results, but don't seem to capture what it's trying to do(reinforcement learning).",0

I'd give her a few weeks off of work because you're both coming home late and it's really tough on her and she's just going to need a break.",0
"You're not her first boyfriend, and she's not your last. There's no reason to hold it over her head, and you can't really force her. 

You might be thinking like this based on the fact that you're dating a girl, rather than a guy. However, most people are dating a guy.",0
Have you tried talking to her about wanting to try and have sex more?,0
A friend told me he dated a girl like this...and it made me feel so bad for her.,0
"I think the first step is for you to figure out what your expectations are, and figure out what your boundaries are. 

Is it ok with you that she has a few days of sex and you know she's in the mood, but you don't cum? Maybe you would prefer to have another day, and you're ok with her having one or two days to catch up.

Are you ok with her having 1 extra day of sex, or 4 extra days, but you know she's in the mood?

You need to have an open mind and really talk about what you want from this relationship.",0

"No, not really.

God doesn't have to be a scientist or an engineer.  God could just be a good person doing his job.

"There is a reason that we, the people, were chosen to make our own wishes. 

It's because when we make our own wishes, we will be able to make them come true. The world is our playground, but it's also our hell. We were bred for life on earth, and now we are the only ones left to live it. 

But it's not like we were bred to die.

As my wish is made, I start to cry. And I look to my wife, for help. 

I look to my wife, but I can't. I can't make her feel that I'm not crying.

I turn my eyes to my daughter, and she can't feel it. She can't let go of her mother, for the girl to feel her mother, and she's lost.

The wish was made, but it was not the wish that I was expecting. I can't even let go of my wife, I can't even let go of my daughter. And yet, there are millions of people on this planet, and not a single one has died, and not a single one has moved on.

My wife is crying, as it's her first time crying in years. I can still give her the money, but I can't give her the people.

I can't even make my wife live for one year.

The rest of the world was in mourning, mourning that poor, poor man. The only difference was, the poor man was dying.

""It's getting closer."" He whispered. ""Please let it come closer! Please no!"" He screamed.

The earth finally came close and the man could hear the people start to scream and run. The earth came closer and closer to him. It was getting closer and closer, faster and faster. But he could still not breath.

The earth came closer and closer. The man screamed again. The earth came closer and closer. The man screamed. The earth came closer and closer. The man started to scream louder and louder.

""I'm so sorry! Please stop! Please stop!"" The man screamed. ""I'll be the one to make you stop. I'll be the one to make you stop so I can live longer!""

The earth was coming closer and closer. The man could only scream so much. The earth was right in front of him now. He was scared. He had nothing left. He knew he would die soon. 

Finally, he could only scream. The earth came closer and closer and finally, the man could only scream. The earth was right in front of him now and could only scream. Soon, the man would die.

"I have to agree with your first comment. I don't think MDMA is for everyone. It is very hard to tell the differences between ""a psych"" and ""an amphetamine"" because it is not metabolised so it doesn't have the same side effects. If one just takes a bunch of pills they will all have the same effects, but different side effects, and that is not an optimal mix. 

If you don't like it, then you don't like it. 

I like MDMA because it releases serotonin, which is known to calm down you. I don't want that to happen all the time, so I take it in small doses. That is also why it is harder to get pure MDMA, it is very rare. 

MDMA can be a party drug, but I prefer to do it in a more sober environment. I don't know why, it just works for me. 

I think an amphetamine is less likely to produce side effects like that, and can be taken to the extreme. 

I would say to try it, because there is no guarantee it will be ""good"". If you like it, then do it. If you don't like it, then don't do it.",0
"MDMA is the only one that works with a psychedelic mindset. I don't know what you're thinking when you say it doesn't work for you, but I feel like you're not completely right in your assessment.

First of all, I don't think MDMA is inherently more or less spiritual. I think there are aspects that can be better appreciated with a psychedelic mindset, and there are other aspects that can't be. When I trip on MDMA, I generally have a strong spiritual experience, but I also see a lot of other aspects of life that are in a very different place than they would be on a psychedelic trip.

I had a few friends who tried MDMA for the very first time and they said that it was the most spiritual experience they ever had. When you use MDMA, your subconscious is trying to get your attention. If you're on a psychedelic trip, your subconscious is trying to get you to go deeper.

When you use MDMA, your brain is trying to get out of the trance induced by the psychedelic experience. This can make you feel extremely uncomfortable and paranoid. This is a natural reaction to the drug.",0
"It's been said that ""MDMA is not for everyone."" I would recommend trying it with another psychedelics. I have had success with shrooms and marijuana, but have not had much success with LSD. But that's just because I haven't done it. I haven't tried psychedelics that much, but I will most likely pick up a tab of whatever I buy this summer. MDMA is not for everyone. I hope it helps.",0
"It's a hard drug to get to know, a lot of people find the roll to be overwhelming. Personally, I find MDMA to be quite relaxing, and at a very basic level, you're rolling your body off.

At the most basic level, it's an amphetamine that's a lot more euphoric than it is stimulating.

You're probably feeling like shit and you need to take some time to figure out what the hell's going on. I wouldn't consider it anything like LSD or shrooms, and I'd say it's more like a psychedelic that can make you feel a bit more down on yourself than LSD, which is more like shrooms.

As such, it's probably not for you.",0
"I would say MDMA is most definitely not a good trip for your first time. I have a friend who took it his first time and said that he felt terrible. I've never tried it, but everyone that I've talked to says the same. The only way you will feel ""normal"" is through a lot of experience with it. I would say you should start with a low dose and wait 8-10 hours before taking it again. That should give you a good taste of the ""bad"" side of it. If you want to take a higher dose, wait up to 24 hours but only take one dose. The reason why you shouldn't take a higher dose is because the high itself can be overwhelming. 

I wish you luck, I can only recommend to take it with people you know that you trust. I think you will have a great time and you will be able to have meaningful conversations with your friends and have a really great time that you won't remember for a long time after your first time.",0
"I've found that mushrooms and shrooms are very similar but you'll have a much easier time with shrooms because of the nausea. The high is very similar as well. The two are also very similar so you can feel the effects of either one at a much quicker rate.

On the other hand you'll have a much stonger ride on MDMA. I mean you'll have a great time at least. But you'll have an extremely difficult time, much harder than shrooms.

You'll likely have the most intense and beautiful experience either on shrooms, or molly, but it will be the most difficult to enjoy it.

So if you're looking for something very intense and very intense, but you'll have a good time on each, and you wouldn't mind the nausea, mushrooms may be a better fit for you.

If you're looking for something very subtle, and easy to enjoy on a lower dose, I may suggest LSD instead. 

I personally think MDMA can be a very nice and nice to have experience, but it's not a good drug to use everyday.",0
"Don't take MDMA if you have depression or suicidal thoughts. That's the only thing I can think of, but you're only 19 so I'm pretty sure you'll be fine.",0

Superman can't even beat Superboy-Prime,0

"I'd say Goku, as it's a bit unfair if it's Superman or Wonder Twins. In the first round, Goku would be able to use all the stuff he knows from the DBZ series and then some. He's a lot more durable, and if it's a fight to the death, he can easily put down Superman or Wonder Twins.

In the second round, Wonder Twins would be in the same range as the first round but Goku could use stuff from his own manga, I don't know what the Wonder Twins' power levels are but even with Superman's power levels, Goku should be able to pull off the Wonder Twins, especially since Superman and Goku are in character.

Finally, in round three, the Wonder Twins would probably be at the same power level as the Wonder Twins in their own series, but Goku should still be able to put them down or even take them out.",0

You don't even have a relationship yet so it's a bit strange to make such a big deal out of this. If she doesn't like you then you're not the one for her. If you're not the one for her then you're not the one for her.

>I have no idea how to get a girl to want to go out with me, and I would like some advice from men who have been in this situation. 

What you want is to find a girl who wants to go out with you because you're hot and they're hot. Then you can go out and get laid until you die.

>I haven't had a girlfriend.

I mean, yeah, you haven't had a relationship. But it's not like you've never had girlfriends. You've got lots of experience and a lot of money and a lot of hobbies, you haven't really had any issues.

>but I am not sure she is the one for me.

What could you possibly offer her that she wouldn't want from another man?",0

"The husband was involved in the woman's disappearance as well. And I'm sorry but it's just a case of ""the husband was a drug addict and the woman was a prostitute""",0
"If the husband is not a suspect in the woman's disappearance, who is?",0
"In the UK, it's quite common to know your missing relative or friend's name, and some of the time some of the details can still be found online. This is the case in the case of this ""missing woman"".

However it really depends on the circumstances, there are a lot of reasons for a family not to report their loved one missing, but they would rather try to keep the family together in some way.

It's not really a case of missing people, missing people are generally kept in the family. 

It's a case of missing person, there isn't really a missing person. The family had a reason to not report the woman missing, but I can't really say what it was. 

The family knows the missing person is dead, you have no idea when. 

Your family has a reason to not report the missing person missing, even if you don't realise it. 

I can't really say what the missing person's son did, but if he was a drug user, then the death of the person was accidental. 

But to jump straight to the end, it's probably no where near what you're looking for, I would say most people wouldn't want to report their loved one missing if they've been missing for a long time.",0
"My thoughts:

1. It's been a few years, so I don't think there is a lot to do with the husband being involved in the woman's disappearance. Maybe he could have been involved, but I don't think that they knew it was him. 

2. I think the police missed a few chances to solve the case. The family doesn't seem to be in the best of health (I mean, if they could still be alive, they could have done more to find the man) and the police are understaffed. I think it's possible they could have saved the woman's life by not pursuing the husband's theories. 

3. It seems like they had a real problem with drugs in the area at the time. As a former police officer who worked around London, I think there's a high chance that the wife was going to get sick and die. The drug scene in London is pretty dangerous and there are lots of places to hide drugs. I could see the police looking into this further, but I think it's going to be much harder with a dead woman and her husband. 

4. I think the ""husband"" was someone who was out to kill her. He got out of prison a few years ago, and when the time came, he decided he was going to take out his revenge. The fact that she was a victim of domestic violence makes this seem much more likely.

5. I think the husband did something to lead to the woman's death. He got really drunk, and I think he was so drunk he blacked out. The husband is definitely responsible for his wife's death, but I think he also had a history of violence toward her. 

6. The police should have done more to find the wife. It's a crime scene, and not a lot of people go in after dark without a good idea of what might be there.",0

"Dear Senator Graham,

We have an important update regarding the current state of food and agriculture in the United States.

First and foremost, I'd like to say that we are deeply saddened by your passing, as you were the only Senator to vote against allowing genetically modified foods to be labeled. While this vote was ultimately a mistake on your part, it was not at all your fault. While we were initially going to try to work with you on the labeling issue, it would have been counterproductive to try to work with you on the issue if you were to be an issue.

So, here is to you, a Senator on the wrong side of history that only needed a little push to start being an issue.

To continue, I'd like to give you a bit of a summary of what happened during the last 48 hours in the United States, so that you will know what to expect next time.

You seem to have been involved in a huge battle with the agricultural community, in which a group of farmers attempted to force a recall of crops from your local grocery store. The recall was ultimately voted down by the voters, but not by a huge margin. If you had not pushed the recall vote through at the last minute, then the farmers would have succeeded.

The recall attempt was made by a group of farmers, who were concerned that the genetically modified products that had been grown with Monsanto's ""Roundup Ready"" traits were causing harm to their crops.

There is a massive backlash against Monsanto, as this was the worst thing the company had ever tried to pull off, and the people who were involved in the recall efforts felt that the farmers should have the choice in what crops they were growing.

Monsanto then hired a large number of lobbyists to try to get the issue off the table for the time being. This effort failed, and it was only a matter of time before the issue would come to a head, and the people who were involved in the recall attempt would receive a fair amount of backlash from the public.

Monsanto, of course, responded with a campaign of their own, one that called for a boycott of any foods that did not contain the genetically modified trait. The company also spent a lot of money trying to get the issue off the table, which they most certainly did.

The issue was brought to the attention of the public again when one of the farmers who were in a fight with Monsanto killed himself.

The government was contacted about this, however, and so they sent a team of researchers out to visit the farm where this farmer killed himself. They were able to confirm the farmer's death, and they were able to find out exactly who the farmer was. This information was then given to the general public.

This was the most recent news in this issue, and there will probably be more updates until the issue is resolved.

In the mean time, the GMO labeling issue continues to be an issue. The people who were involved in the recall effort have been arrested, and the government is looking into the possibility of a murder charge.

Also, while we did not get the food recall bill passed, it was passed by the House of Representatives, and is now being considered by the Senate.

Sincerely,

The FDA",0

I usually do it in missionary and have a little surprise of my dick in her vagina.",0
Dive.,0
"I'm assuming you're using condoms? You'll want to do it on the side with the legs up, that way if the condom breaks it won't fall down your shaft and ruin the experience, and you can still give it a little rimjob to keep it from falling down. Also with any position you want to do it on the side, you can lean forward a bit to give yourself more space to get a good angle, and keep the rimjob going. You can also use a dildo if you need a couple of inches or so to get a good angle, and you can try going a bit more down on the dildo, then back up on the dildo and slowly work both of you into the proper position.",0
"That depends on what you want in this position.  If you want a lot of foreplay, use a chair for a while.

If you want to be really into it, get a couch.  Sit on your knees and get all the way on your elbows.  

I prefer the missionary position as well, but you can do a lot more with the doggy style.",0
"The only real problem with doggy style is that once you're in that position, it's hard to change the angle. If you can somehow get her off first, you can go missionary. But you can't really do that with a girl because she's not really into it.",0
"Doggy style is the best position for dp. I do this and love it if I am on top with my boyfriend. If I'm on my back and he is on his knees, we do it like a couple in a spooning position.

Other than that, doggy does wonders for PIV. When you are on your back, you can use a lot more of your hand, and when you are on your back you can use your legs for leverage.

If you want to make your husband happy and get him off, try to find a way to make him cum at the same time as you. It may sound stupid, but when you do this, he will think it's the best thing ever to help you.",0
"I like doggy style, since I do it with my partner with her arms tied behind her back.",0
The woman can sit on the edge of the bed.,0
"I think the best position is doggy style. 

You can switch it up a little bit however, if you feel like you're not enjoying doggy, you can do some reverse cowgirl style, or reverse doggy style. These can be fun if you want to have some control over your partner.",0
"I like being on top.  I like being in control.  I like to be the one to make the moves, not the other way around.",0
"I only do DP for the girl, but I do not recommend missionary for the guy. I have a hard time getting the guy hard, even with a few fingers inside me and I'm not very experienced. So I would have to do doggy to start off with, and then use my hands or a toy to start the session up. This will increase the pleasure to the guy but you'll start off with a lot less pleasure from the girl",0
Fight with my kids. They're way better,0
"So, what if you don't want to fight with your kids? Do they go out to war?",0
"I'll fight my kids. I never thought about it being with my kids. I'm the only one who knows how to fight, and I feel bad for my kids. That being said, they will need to be trained to fight and I'm not sure the best way. I'm not sure the best way to train them either.",0

"It has been observed that when the universe is young, it appears that every large region of the universe is occupied by an extraordinarily large number of stars and planets, but once it gets large enough that the number of stars and planets falls off, a period of star formation occurs, and then the number of stars and planets falls off. 

The number of stars and planets grows in a pattern that is similar everywhere, but the number of planets grows in a pattern that varies between small numbers. This pattern is called the [Hubble Constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_constant). We can infer that the abundance of the stars increases over time, probably as the stars become more common. But there is still some uncertainty about the exact rate at which the number of planets increases.

[Here is a paper on the subject](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.3360.pdf) from 2010, that explains some of the uncertainties.",0
"I am not sure of the answer. One thing is that we cannot see life growing outside our universe.

Another is that the growth rate varies between different planets.",0
"For the moment, no. There are currently no known other life forms in the universe.",0
"It's the other way around. In our universe, large life forms are needed to help produce more life. As life grows, it needs more life to support itself. But it takes time for a new life form to form. Our universe is only about 3 billion years old and we have a lot of time yet to form the first life form. If we were to have the same growth rate as ours, the life on earth would be here at least 5 billion years.",0
"As we've seen, some life exists, so it is *possible* that there is life elsewhere in the universe. However, because the existence of other forms of life has not been directly observed, no one knows for certain if it is even possible.",0
"I knew he was but he was a cat,

"""Old man""

""Cat""",0
Oh my gosh you're a cat!,0
Looks more like he's just trying to get his picture taken..,0
The old man has a cat?,0
I think it's the cat's way of saying he's not gonna live to adulthood. Like he's trying to save up for retirement.,0
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww,0

I found it through Amazon and have no plans to change it, but it has a few extra features, and the cordless table saw is a bit heavier than a table saw.",0
The meaning of life is to explore. To be in a state of wonder. I wouldn't say the end of your existence is the meaning of life. Maybe the meaning of life is the journey to come.,0
">It's interesting to compare ourselves to other life forms, and I like the idea of understanding other life forms.

I think it's the only way we can experience what life is truly like, and I have trouble understanding life without it.",0
We all are on the path to be ourselves and learn about what makes us who we are.,0
I am the one who is in control of my life. Life is the most beautiful thing we have to experience. It is the only thing that is truly real.,0
"I think you're confusing meaning with purpose. Purpose is what we do as humans, meaning, on the other hand, is what we do as individuals. 

It's more important to have meaning, because you can't really do much unless you have a purpose to do it with.",0
I honestly don't know. I am confused by your question.,0
I think the point of life is to live.,0
What is really funny is that the kitten is wearing an American flag hat. I remember seeing this on Instagram.,0

i like this.,0
"Just watched this yesterday and I can't get over the feeling that the writer and director were trying to be too ""controversial"" and ""out there"" and that it's a bad film. I watched it with my boyfriend, and he was actually quite shocked that they went with the name, and that the film was actually that good. I was kind of shocked myself. I thought it would be a mess of some kind. And yet, when you watch it for the first time, it hits you all at once and is so good.",0
"Oi m8, no fokn way is this a real movie? This is a trailer for a porno.",0
"I'm sorry, who is this film for and what makes it so good? I've never even heard of it.",0
I'm really sorry you are going through this. I don't know what to tell you at this point. I really hope you can find a new career path. Good luck in all your future endeavors.,0
"You deserve to have your dream and be able to do it without the stress and pressure of your current career. If you can find a way to do that, I think you will find it easier to be happy once you do.",0
"Are you in school or working at the moment? Can you afford a decent amount of tuition for your children? I'm curious what career path you would like to take, and if it would suit you better.",0
"As someone who has been a stay-at-home parent for a while now, I have to say this.

I have been able to go on vacation quite a lot. I have been able to go on trips where we have no responsibilities. I can buy my own food and go out and enjoy life. I have been able to go on a ski trip with my family, where we both have the time to enjoy the trip and not have to worry about work. When you are able to make your own money, you can go out and do things.

What you want isn't going to happen if you stay at home. You are doing a job. It's not meant to be all fun - and you don't get paid enough to just relax. You are giving up a happy routine that is all you can really afford.

I don't think it'll be easy, but I really hope you feel like you're being a good parent. I really hope you are happy.",0
"I'm so sorry to hear this. 

I have a friend who's a full time teacher with multiple years experience, but she works about 50 hours a week. I love her to death, but she's just so exhausted from all the shit she deals with. I know what you're feeling too. 

I'm on my own little journey of getting a PhD in the same field as you, but I have another 2 years or more to go before I have the chance to do it. 

You're going to make it. And I think you'll be so proud of yourself.",0
Don't quit now. You're not giving up just to be happy. You need this more than anyone. You are still going to do all you can to be a good father for your children.,0
"I am so damn tired of being the only one that can do something. Especially when there are always so many opportunities to do better. So many families in this world that still feel like they are stuck in the mud. I know you feel like that too, but keep trying. There is always someone that wants to do better for his/her family.

Good luck.",0

"I'm very sorry to hear about your problems and I wish you the best of luck. I would consider myself a psychologist, and am well-versed in the mental and psychological disorders of the left. I believe you may have something called ""oppositional defiance disorder"" or ""oppositional defiant disorder"" and that you may be suffering from it, a very serious mental illness. I see it all the time, and it is debilitating. I am well-versed in it, and so I can help you sort it out and find a solution, or if it seems impossible to do so, I can refer you to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.

In your case, it may be best to seek professional help from a psychologist. When I was a psychologist, I treated a man who had no family history of it, but when I brought it up to him, he got angry, and refused to believe me. It was pretty traumatic, and I still don't know exactly how to help him, but I think I can make you understand why he was like that.",0
"I think it's pretty natural to feel some stress of a new place, especially since the new family is kind of new. I think it could be related to other aspects of life, like stress about other aspects of life like school or work. I would think about where it's coming from, what you're feeling, and maybe you can look at your life, and see what's causing the stress.",0

"If you're having all these experiences and they're taking their toll on you, then I think you need to take a break from reddit.  I have many friends who struggle with depression and anxiety and I can tell you that reddit is not a healthy environment for someone who needs help.

If you're having these experiences, you can also look into a psychiatrist or counseling service.  I think it's important to have somewhere to talk with someone if you think your life is in danger.  My friends are some of the kindest and most supportive people I know and I would recommend starting with them.  You can also try looking for a psychiatrist or counselor through your employer, or your school district.  If you're going through a hard time and feeling suicidal, a suicide hotline would be a good place to start.

If you need someone to talk to about these feelings you're having, feel free to message me or any of my other friends.",0

"I have to run for 30-40 minutes at the least a couple of times a week. I have been running my regular times for about two months and my form is terrible. I need to work on my form.

I see some people on here that run with no issues running 3k/4k.

I've noticed that my stride is pretty wide and my right leg seems to trail the left a bit. Also the left has a lot of body weight on it. I need to work out my right hip more and get a better stance. I should also work on my right side more.

Also I haven't ran in about two weeks. My back is killing from all the running and my legs feel like they're going to explode when I jump.

Any tips?",0
"Run with a slightly bent knee. It'll help to avoid shin splints.

Running in your shoes is the best (only) way to go. It's not easy at all. You can also switch from barefoot to normal shoes, but you have to find a running store and talk to a salesperson, not an online recommendation.",0
I think a combination of this and being too high on your knees is going to kill your knees.  I think you should try lowering the bar to your mid toes and try to squat to parallel with that.  And I think you should work on your core a little more.,0

"Your legs are too long. A lot of times when people say a beginner's running form is to 'keep your back straight', they mean keep your back straight to the point of pushing the ground away. When you're pushing the ground away with your back, you're pushing your legs. The longer you stay in a 'stable' position (aka a straight back), the quicker your legs will get tired.

Try to use your legs more, and use a slightly wider stance. If your legs don't move much, you're going to tire your legs out too quickly, which makes your form even more off.",0

"If you want to know if a number is prime, there are two things to consider:

* Is it a known, known prime?  In other words, *does it have a known name*?  

* Is it one of ""those"" numbers?  These are the numbers which have a known name, but are not known to be prime in any sense of the word.  For example, the number 10^(4) might be a prime number, but it was not named as such.  

For the former, we could ask a number of people, then check how many people answered a given question.  The question might be ""are the numbers 1, 2, and 3 prime"", or ""are the numbers 5, 6, and 7 prime"".  

For the latter, we'd ask a bunch of mathematicians who are experts on the number, then let them all guess the number.  It wouldn't be too hard to gather some expert numbers, and then ask them to guess if the number was prime.  Once they all figured the number out, we'd check that answer.

"In 16th century, the Dutch scientist Jan Hoekstra published a map of the world. His map was based on the world's cartographers using a grid-like system. He used the earth's circumference as his ""trend line"" and used that as his baseline. He then measured the circumference of the world and divided it into 12 equal sections. He then calculated the distance between the two points by measuring the difference in the height of the two points. He then took the distance between the two points and divided that into a hundred and seventy-two sections and measured the distance between these sections. Finally, he divided this calculation into the distance between the two points. The result was the earth's circumference.

"God's Word is literally the first and most comprehensive of the Scriptures. The Word is not metaphorical. 

>1 Thessalonians 4:11-12
>11 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, since the birth pangs of Christ are almost at an end.
>12 For the birth pangs of Christ are near at hand.

I think this is the best way to phrase it. The Bible is the only way to understanding God's word. To take it literally means to take it in the sense of the word ""as an object of knowledge"" and ""as a physical object."" (See the first paragraph of 1 Corinthians 14 for more on this idea.)

And how you use the metaphor is up to you. But my only advise would be to avoid the use of the word ""metaphor"" or ""metaphorical."" A metaphor is a word used to express something in a way that is not literal.",0

The heart is the source of all sin, and the source of all good.  
It's also where we come into our body, and where we are born.  So it's a pretty good way of saying that God is the source of all our goodness, and all our good.

The other thing to keep in mind, though, is that God's words ARE our words.  Not only the words, but also the intention behind them.  Our words can have an impact on our actions.  And God has a very long-term plan, and He will use words to guide us to that plan.",0

> There is also a huge opportunity for the Democrats to gain a huge amount of ground with the Latino vote in the near future. The population of the United States is projected to grow from 12.6 million in 2014 to almost 18 million in 2040. By 2030, Latino birth rates are projected to increase dramatically, reaching nearly 50 million births. This means that nearly half of the population of this country will be Latino by 2040.

> This shift in the population is not necessarily going to be distributed evenly among the party's candidates for the next decade. The Democrats will have to spend their energies targeting Hispanic voters specifically and in particular the fastest growing political demographic within the United States.

> In a two-party system the Republican Party will need to spend much more energy targeting Hispanic voters than the Democratic Party will. The reason is that Latinos are far more likely to vote Republican than to vote Democratic. Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic in the country, and as they continue to grow, they are getting increasingly Democratic.

>> In fact, the average Hispanic voter supports Democrats by a margin of almost 20 points. That is the largest margin of any demographic other than Asians.

"It's the next Doom. The first Doom was released in 1993. And in this case, the company is now called Bethesda Softworks, which is the same company that makes Fallout and Elder Scrolls.",0
"The only problem with Doom is the id tech engine. The gameplay is so much better, and the story is much better.",0
The Doom reboot was a disaster with nothing but the most generic and boring gameplay imaginable.,0
"I'm not saying it will be, but my assumption is that it will be very similar to the first one.  This is the last game I bought for my PC.",0
Doubt it's the next Doom. The last Doom had pretty mediocre reviews.,0
"I've actually always thought Doom was a pretty good game.  I played it with my girlfriend, and it was actually pretty fun.  It was easy to pick up, and it's a great game to get into.",0
"I just want to have fun with a game. I'm not going to give you all this info so you can run some kind of benchmark and judge the graphics of the game. I'm saying that if somebody wants to make a Doom-like game, that's pretty reasonable. Also, I've played Doom 2 (and 3) at least 3 times and I still don't care for it.",0
No.,0
That's a pretty cool concept,0

"It happens.  

I used to work as a copywriter.  I get my work email from someone.  I go to check it out, nothing there.  I go back, it's not there, so I go to check again.  No luck.

I tried the same thing with my work email.  It still isn't there.  It's been 3 years.

This happened a couple of times, each time it went to the trash for some reason.",0

"I'm so confused, too! I'm sorry! 

I'm on my phone at work so I hope some of you can link me some of the posts?",0
My question is why?,0
"I've read other people's stories about this, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing. You have two friends, both of which are named Mark, and an email in the account that reads ""jeanne@example.com"". 

It's a common mistake, like people having the same name as their ISP. If you have an email in your name, but spelled differently, the email address will not match up with the name. 

The email might not even belong to Jeanne in the account.",0
I was in an identical situation with a friend of mine. I couldn't find her post because of the search bar when I went to her profile. I just assumed she had posted it somewhere else but I couldn't find it.,0
I'd start in Spain and then go to Paris. I'd spend a couple of days in Paris and then visit Barcelona. From there make our way to the Swiss Alps and just ski down to France. Then fly back to London. You'd be good to go.,0
I would like to see you guys meet and travel.,0
"This sounds a bit expensive, but you could do a trip around Europe as a 2-3 month long trip. I think you won't have to pay for a hotel room anywhere. Just buy cheap hostel books and you'll be fine. It's not impossible to do this with a roommate.",0
"The main thing I'm noticing with the title of this movie is that it's based off of an actual story, a story that's well known in the book world. The movie is a retelling of that story written from the perspective of one of the characters who lived through it.",0
"A Quiet Place is one of my top 3 favorite movies, it's a fun, scary and surreal movie. One of my friends and I go to the cinema to watch a few of the movies for Halloween like this one, but I can't remember the name of that other one, but I do remember the feeling of dread we had and the visuals we got.",0
"I really enjoyed the movie, but the book is so good. I read it years ago. It was well written and easy to get into.",0
Holy shit I actually have the book...,0

Have you ever spoken to your boss since? What happened if he's still around that office?",0

This story is awesome.,0
"Wow, that's a good one! I had a long time client at another company and he would always call me at home and get me to call him back. I called my boss to let him know I was coming home and that he should not call me. Of course I had to call him back and just hang up. When I finally got a call from him, he sounded a lot more confident. I never had a client or boss like that before.",0
"A crisis is a major change for the worse. You could say that people with mental problems are in a crisis, but there's no crisis.

It's more like a major change that you can't take in, but you're not worried about, so you don't panic.",0
"I don't know if this counts as a ""crisis"" but here's the plot summary from the Wikipedia page:

>The film's main villain, Detective Frank Stokes (played by John Cusack), has a mental illness that causes his paranoia and violence.  He is so paranoid, in fact, that he believes the police are trying to eliminate him with poison gas, rather than arresting him

The film, adapted from the novel ""The Quiet Room"", is a psychological thriller about a man with a mental disorder that causes him to believe his world is in danger.

"I think the title of the post might have something to do with it, but even if it's just the title, it's sooo good.",0
"Your husband is an immature person and not mature enough to communicate about important things. He will not be able to communicate about this and will probably do the same ""I'm too old"" thing again.",0
"I mean... I'm not sure how much of a difference we can make. 

I've read a lot of comments/studies indicating that a person's ability to get a woman off is related to their age (and some suggest that being a virgin is correlated to being older, but that there are other variables related to fertility and aging that are at play). 

I don't think it's reasonable to expect your partner to be your sex God, or your best friend with the best sex ever, or whatever. There are a lot of things that can be done to increase your sex life, but I think you should be honest with him and discuss how it is with you.",0
">  I want to tell him how much I appreciate the fact that he is willing to do all this for me.

Just as a thought: if he is not enjoying it, he's not enjoying it. That may sound ridiculous, but he might be struggling to orgasm and not realizing that. You can't force him to enjoy it, but you can make him enjoy it.

I know you said you're not complaining, but I'm wondering if maybe you're worried about making him feel unsatisfied, or if it's more about the relationship than the sex. There is a difference between trying to be in love with your partner and trying to love your partner. I would suggest talking about what you each think are the main reasons for not having sex. If he doesn't know, or you are uncomfortable sharing, you can start there.

If you don't know, you can both explore the reasons that would prevent you from having sex. When you're together, it's really important to you that you can have sex, but sometimes you can't. It's not a big deal, but sometimes things go wrong.

If he's not having success with you, that's not necessarily a deal breaker. Sometimes things just don't work, but you can still be in love with each other and still have sex.",0
"""I want to be appreciated for what I do for you. I want you to be proud of me for that.""",0
You need to decide what you want.  You can't just decide to have sex more often.  Tell him that you have changed in the past year and that you no longer know how to have sex with him because of that.,0

"Greece had a very diverse cultural history.

Greek cities often competed with each other, and in many ways fought each other for the city's prestige. The Greeks saw themselves as the representatives of the whole of the Greek people, and therefore had a strong sense of civic duty to represent the interests of the city as a whole.

Some scholars have proposed that the Greeks were motivated to make large sacrifices, as this would improve their reputation, and thus their own standing in society.

A second motivation was the desire to maintain a strong military presence. Greece was the largest landowner in the known world, and the best place to maintain control of the sea. 

The Romans eventually defeated Greece during the Peloponnesian War, and then occupied Greece for some time.

The Athenians began to expand their city boundaries, and then moved on to the Aegean regions, which were very important to them. The Greek people generally welcomed the Romans over the Persians, and this contributed to a significant cultural exchange between the two cultures.

The Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC is also important. The Persians conquered the Greek states of Asia Minor, and made a number of demands of the Greeks that would become a core of later Greek political philosophy. The Persians were motivated to try to expand their own territory, and this is why the Greek states fought back. The Persians had to give up land and territory in order to get peace, and this is why the Greeks were so insistent on the Persian's surrender.

I'm afraid I can't offer much more than that. I have a fairly basic knowledge of Greek history, but I don't know much beyond that.",0
"This is an interesting question, which I've had trouble framing. 

The short answer is: it was a question of culture. 

Ancient Greece had a deep fascination with the world they lived in. Plato, the architect of the modern world, has a particular affinity for the idea of philosophy, and many of the people he was writing to were drawn to it as well. The Greeks of the time had a deep interest in philosophy.

So, they were working out their own version of what philosophy should be, and they weren't interested in just having a bunch of philosophical discussions. They wanted to create a sort of ideal of the world they wanted to live in. 

I think this is a common thread throughout most of the ancient world, and one that remains to this day.",0
"I have been working on a book for the past year that deals with the historical development of Ancient Greece and it's relationship to Europe. I will be discussing Greek Philosophy, the development of Hellenistic Philosophy, and the rise of Greek Civilization. You can see the list of topics from my homepage here.

http://www.theoryofhistory.org/",0
"The topic of ""Philosophy"" is usually a difficult one to deal with in academic history but I have a few comments which hopefully will shed some light on the subject. 

The first thing to say is a lot of the discussion on ""Philosophy"" tends to focus on the Greek world. 

The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, the Greek world was a very large world which encompassed a huge number of different cultures and peoples. Secondly, the Greek world had a lot of impact on Europe and the Mediterranean. 

To start with the first of these points, it is important to note that the Greek world was much larger than we are used to thinking about it. The ancient world is generally defined as from the end of the third century BC to the fall of the Western Empire (and the beginning of the Roman Empire, when the term ""Ancients"" was coined). However, the Greek world was much larger, a continent that included the entire Mediterranean and extended into the Atlantic. The sheer size of the Greek world meant that they had a lot of influence on the history of the Mediterranean and beyond, which is how you get the Roman Empire and the later formation of the Byzantine Empire. 

The second point I want to make is the impact the Greek world had on the world. For instance, Greece had a very large footprint in the Middle East by the time of the Roman Empire. This isn't because their power was particularly great or because the Middle East was particularly religious or that the Middle East was particularly hostile to Greek culture. The reason for this was that there were a number of factors including but not limited to: Greek expansion, trade (which was one of the reasons they gained control of North Africa), and the role of Greek merchants. The Greek empire also controlled the eastern Mediterranean, which in turn meant Greek merchants had a large impact on the development of the middle east and the development of Islam. These two factors created a very complex situation which eventually spilled over to Europe, which is where we get the spread of Greek culture and religion. 

In short, the Greek world had a lot more on it than the Greek word ""philosophy"" suggests.",0
"[This might be a short summary of what would be the main focus of Ancient Greece.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1a8hjd/where_did_the_word_philosophy_come_from/)

Also, I've seen the comments, and apparently I'm not the only one who was frustrated at the fact that my boyfriend didn't want to abort the baby.  I was happy with the decision to keep it, and I would have done the same thing in their place.",0
"If she's on birth control and she makes that choice, let her be.",0
"As a guy the whole process of pregnancy is a pain in the ass. I know how life feels and I know that the life you are giving birth to is not your own. And that is what makes the decision so hard for me. 

So I will say the absolute most important thing is that you were responsible enough to take responsibility for the pregnancy, and I believe that is what you should do. If you can't do that, then go get some birth control and be responsible for yourself.",0

Enfin bonjour, je vous la trouve c'est bon :D",0
"They were a large group of friends heading off to a restaurant later that afternoon. I was on the outskirts of town, enjoying a nice day with the family. However, I was a bad cook and a bad diner. I had to use my hands to scoop and fry the hotdogs. I had a hard time getting them to hold their shape on the griddle. 

I watched as they were slowly cooked and then sliced along their length. It was time. I put the hotdogs back on the griddle, waiting for the perfect moment. Finally, they were cooked right in their shape and I had to let them rest. My hands were tired, but I was happy to get the hotdog slices. I grabbed them from the table to get them out of my jacket, but I found a pocket to keep them in. It was a little snug, but it was a good fit. I set the pocket on my hip, but it was easy to get the hotdog slices out when I needed them. 

I went back to the table and they were ready. I told them to grab a seat and let me know when they are ready. They agreed, and I took my seat in the middle of the table. My eyes were fixated on the hot dog slices on the table. I took a large bite. A warm delicious feeling was starting in my throat. I took another bite. The same feeling started up the back of my throat. 

""What a waste,"" I muttered to myself. I pulled the hotdog slices from my pocket and swallowed. I was in heaven. 

For a few moments, I kept my eyes on the hotdog. It was amazing. I closed my eyes and concentrated on the hot dog. I felt a warm feeling starting in my stomach. I was getting ready to eat. I pulled my hotdog slices from my pocket and began to chew. The hotdog began to melt in my mouth. I swallowed again. I looked at the hotdog again. It was the perfect shape. I looked at my hands. I had a bit of a headache.

One holocron, however, was just too many. It's massive bulk was making it difficult to get into, and the holo-architects were still working on making the rest of the empire. This holocron had to be completed on time, or else it would be the end of the entire galaxy.

""I've waited a long time, and now it's good to see I can finally come home."" said a voice that could easily be a woman's.

""I know, it's been difficult for you, but you'll all be alright."" another, louder, voice replied as the holocron was brought into the sky.

""It's good to finally be back. As you can see, we have completed your empire. I hope that your people are well.""

""I really hope so. I hope that our people are well. I hope that you are well.""

The holocron was brought down into the ground, ready to be transported into space. The entire galaxy was filled with a palpable sense of excitement. If only there were someone to witness it.

""You will all be safe, if you return to your homes and prepare yourselves for the war to come."" said a deeper, voice.

""And where shall I be transported to?"" a third, quieter voice asked.

""I'm not sure, it's up to you.""

The holocron was lowered into the ground again, and all three holocrons began to be transported. A few moments later, the holocron was on a ship that had been transporting the other two holocrons.

""Now, we'll have to prepare for the war. If you'll all just follow me, I will give you all a tour.""

The holocron was lowered to the ground once again, and the holocrons were transported to the new galaxy.

""Now, I must go, I'm sorry for the late meeting,"" said the holocron, as the ship took off.

""I know, but I hope that we can all be well, together."" the holocron said as it disappeared into the distance.

""I know, it's been so long. I must go."" said another voice.

""I knew it was something important, they are here. I'm not sure if I can stand it, but I have to.""

""What is wrong with you? You have all the time in the world, it's not like the holocrons are going anywhere.""

""I won't let them leave, they are my family, they are my friends.""

The holocron took off once again, this time into the distance. The first holocrons had been transported successfully, but the second holocron was already in orbit. It was not going to be long before it was the only one left, and the fleet couldn't be ready in time.",0
"The first holocrons, created after the battle of Endor, were used to hold the first Jedi temple on Coruscant, and the first temple was the key to the Empire's new control. It was thought to be the end of the Jedi, a symbol of their fall, but as the Jedi's power waned the Empire was forced to use holocrons to maintain their power. From the moment the holocron was created, the galaxy was rocked by a religious war. 

The first holocron had a holomajority of holocrons, one of which was dedicated to the Jedi, to be used in the new empire. The majority of them were used as a way to keep order, to control the population, to keep the population docile and fearful. They also had a holocron dedicated to the new Emperor, one of the last holocrons still used. It was used to build the Empire's power, and the most powerful holocron in the Empire.

The holocrons were used to control the people, and to create the Empire. They were a way to keep the people docile and fearful, and a way to keep order. The Emperor, however, hated the holocrons, and had the holocrons taken away. He had the holocrons taken from every holocrons, and they were never used again.

The galaxy was not at peace, and neither was the Empire. The Empire was always at war.

The first holocrons were taken out of Empire hands, and they were used to create one new empire. They were used to create the Empire's power. One holocron was used by the first Emperor, and the Holocrons of that holocron were used by the new Empire.

The first Emperor was the only one without holocrons, and it was his holocrons that were used. Without holocrons, the new empire was doomed.

One holocrons was used to create the new Empire's power, and one holocrons was used to create the first emperor's power.",0

""The first holocron had a success, but then the High Council decided to keep it.""

""No one knows why the High Council kept the First holocron. No one knows why the First holocron was created, and why it failed.

""Why did the High Council decide to keep the First holocron, and why did it fail?""

""The High Council decided to keep the First holocron to maintain a technological advantage over the competition. The High Council needed to maintain an advantage. The High Council did this, but the High Council also did this to create another holocron. They did this to create a second holocron, and another holocron. They did this, and kept doing this, until the holocron we have is an extremely large galaxy, and the holocron we have is just the first holocron.""

I have had a dream where a farting man was chasing me around my house. I was terrified and I ran into my friend's backyard. Then I woke up.,0
"I had the same dream last night. My best friend, who's also my sister, was having sex with a guy in our house at night. I just ran. It was really intense. It made me a little nervous. It was a really nice dream, though.",0

So I just have to be smart about it, and know my limits and how I can get to them.

It's so beautiful, but I have no way to go about getting it. It's an important thing to go through and I just can't do that right now. I'm on the brink of despair. 

I'm glad you had the experience, as it's probably the best thing you'll have that will change your perception of reality. But it's so important to see it through to the end, and I've spent too much time not enjoying the trip because I had no motivation to do so.

I'm so sorry that it's been taken away from you.",0
You need to find your spiritual connection.,0
"Life is not about validation, it's about growth and change. And psychedelics can help you grow and change, and you can experience both. 

If you can't handle that, maybe you need to change something about yourself in your life. Maybe you're not growing, or maybe you are, but your growth is stunted by things in your life that prevent you from experiencing your full potential.",0

"I feel like I can't tell you how much I understand about reality, but I can tell you how much it doesn't matter. 
Your belief that your experience matters is the very belief that is causing you to feel like this. 

What you experience could be a good thing, but it could also be a terrible thing.

I personally can't even consider these possibilities. And if you find yourself thinking that things are wonderful, then you should take a look at why you think that.

What you're experiencing could be a terrible thing.
If you're not a great person, then there's nothing you can do to change that. But I've found that I have to be a better person to become a better person.

I don't even care about tripping anymore because it's not fun. No matter how much I try to enjoy it, it still feels like you're trying to put something on a fucking rope.",0
"I think we're all just trying to figure out the same thing as you.  We want to experience life and the universe. We have a belief system that says it only has meaning within the context of our own existence. 

The ""I have a personal meaning to life"" worldview is a construct of the ego. 

Some people think that the universe is the universe, and that everything is just a manifestation of a greater energy source. Other people think that everything is just an idea that we call ""life"".

These two viewpoints are two sides of the same coin. They're both ways of looking at the same thing.

I think the best way to see what's going on is through a philosophical lens. So the best way to see your trip is to ask questions about it. I think you'll find that the trip is the only real answer.",0

You should also be able to smoke at work. If you smoke everyday it will be bad for your health. Smoking at work can also give you a mild headache. I recommend you should go to the doctor and get it checked out.

If you're worried about it though, just do a tiny amount of edibles.",0
"I feel like if you smoke a quarter, you could get stoned off of a regular amount of weed.",0
"It just depends on how much you smoke. If you smoke a lot of weed, it will do more than just give you the high. When I was a freshman in high school, my dealer would smoke a quarter of weed when he gave me. I was going to highschool, and I had a pretty decent amount at that time (5 grams). When he gave me that quarter, the high i got from it was nothing compared to the high that I was going to get from being high all day.

You should still be able to get high off of a regular amount of weed, but just smoke a little and you will get a lot of the high off of the marijuana.",0
"I have my job to worry about, have a good day! I hope you're having a great day!",0
The amount of weed you smoke is much more powerful. You can get stoned off of a quarter of weed but not as strong as if you smoked the entire quarter. So it's better to smoke a quarter of weed then smoke the whole quarter.,0

"My guess is that as long as the magnetic field in the D-Meter's inner core remains positive, the electrons in the D-Meter's outer core will remain in a ""negative"" state. The electrons will move to the outer core, where they will be pushed out of the D-Meter's outer core and continue their motion. The electrons will then be able to move to the inner core.

This is what you're asking about, and the answer is that the electrons are ""switched on"" in the D-Meter's outer core, because the electrons don't like being in a negative state.

The D-Meter's inner core is also the ""on"" state, because electrons like being in a positive state.

The D-Meter's outer core is ""off"", because electrons don't like being in a negative state.

When the D-Meter's outer core is ""off"", it will read 0 in a quantum field.

When the D-Meter's outer core is ""on"", it will read D-Meters in a quantum field.

When the D-Meter's outer core is ""on"", the electrons will be ""switched on"" in the D-Meter's outer core because the electrons like being in a ""positive"" state.

When the D-Meter's outer core is ""on"", the electrons will be ""switched on"" in the D-Meter's inner core because the electrons like being in a ""negative"" state.

When the D-Meter's outer core is ""on"", the electrons will be ""switched on"" in the D-Meter's inner core and push the electrons out of the D-Meter's outer core, and will read 0 in a quantum field.",0

I knew it was a reference to them.,0
"I think it's about you starting to hate a former friend so much that you can't stop thinking about them.

It's not a bad dream at all -- it's just a reflection of how you feel.",0
"You are using her as a crutch for your own problems.

You need to start to move on.",0
"It's normal to feel a little jealous about your current girlfriend. You dream of her and hope that you can see her again. She's the girl you dated for 5 years, and you miss her. You want her back. You want her to be with you still. The next time you are alone with her, you will have sex. You will have sex with your ex. You will get your wish and see her again. 

The dream may also be about you wanting to be the leader of the relationship now. It's not just the ex. It's your current girlfriend and how you feel about her.

So, you are trying to make her feel bad about what she did to you. That's something you can't control, but it is important to think about. If you can't make her feel bad, you need to make her feel that she is in a new relationship. That means you need to get her out of this one. It's a relationship that is not going to last. It doesn't matter how many times you see her, it doesn't matter how many times you talk to her, it doesn't matter how many times you have sex. She will break up with you. She will break up with you.",0
"You are going to have to deal with this situation. Its not going to change unless you deal with it. And you better deal with it, you better do it now or you are going to regret it in the morning.",0
It could be about a relationship going off the rails for either of you.,0
"Just because she had sex with you only 2 months ago, it means that she has some kind of attraction for you. But still, she has her own reasons and that you can't change them. So yeah, sex can symbolize some activity that is shared between you two, even if you are not having sex during the dream.

But it's not your fault, you should never blame others in your dreams and make them feel bad. Most of the time, people are just reflecting on themselves.",0
"Happens to me occasionally, i'll have a dream that someone is about to have sex with my ex and I will freak out and try to talk them out of it. I know that I will never be able to trust her again because she probably already has a boyfriend. I just wanna be sure that I never will.",0
"Dreams are meant to show you something about yourself, you need to ask yourself why you think about her? Are you still attracted to her?",0
"I don't want to be a total dick but, why would sex with your ex be in your dream?",0
"There is some truth in the dream. You are frustrated with your girlfriend and your actions, and you're trying to make it as difficult as possible for her to reconcile the situation with you.

The fact that she's been friends with you for five years, and you still think about her makes me think you miss her, but you feel guilty about it. You're aware of that and are trying to prevent her from feeling guilty about it.

It sounds like there's something going on in your life that you're trying to work through. Perhaps you feel like you're falling behind. The dream is reminding you that your relationship with your girlfriend is important, and that you're trying to get back on track.

I know it's tough to figure out what the dream means, but my best guess is that you want the best for your girlfriend, but you're feeling worried about the future. If you're worried about falling behind, you might feel like the girlfriend is taking things too far, and you're not sure how to keep the relationship going without a hitch.

In any case, if you feel like you need some kind of dream interpretation, here are some resources that I use when interpreting dreams:

"I think the dream is saying that your ex is making you doubt your ability to be friends with her. That makes me think that you are afraid that you can't be friends with her and it's making you doubt yourself. You want to be friends with her, but it seems like it's not going to be the case. 

The dream is a reflection of your feelings. What part of the dream do you think is related to feeling like the friendship isn't the same as it once was?",0
The dream is probably telling you to give her back.  What does it mean to you?,0

I took some time to think of the simplest way to solve the problem, then, of course, the next moment, I remembered to check my email.

">Would it be better if the word was used in a more general sense? Like the word ""yes"" can be used to describe other things, but also be used when describing things that aren't directly related with yes.

I don't really see the point in this.  

>In your opinion, which one is the best?

The one that's easy to remember.   

When you come up with a word, it has to be related to the word's meaning, so you need to give it some sort of meaning.  

For example, if you were to make up a word for ""diet"", you would need to give it some sort of meaning.  

Also, you are free to add more meanings to it, but you will lose the simplicity of the word.",0
"My initial thought is that a very, very strong yes, with emphasis on the word, can come from the word for ""yes"". You don't have to say that is the word though; just using it to mean ""yes"" is fine.

The theory that he's not actually gone is pretty weak too. There's no evidence that he actually is gone, and the most obvious reason why he wouldn't be is because he's not dead. The theory that he's just in Arkham City is the only one that makes sense.",0

But a lot of people were implying that the Joker is in Arkham City because he was in Arkham Asylum.,0
"I'm gonna go ahead and say that this theory is correct. As many people have pointed out, the Joker is indeed still alive.

However, I think many fans are being a bit too hasty in declaring that the Joker is dead. This is because the Joker is a *classic supervillain*. This means that he has been shown to be capable of committing crimes and committing acts of violence, but he is still *human*. The Joker is still a person. 

In the case of the game, we know what would happen after the game ends. The Joker will either die, or he will go into hiding. This is not an impossible scenario. Even if he does not commit crime, it is possible that he will disappear and reappear somewhere else. There is absolutely no reason to assume that the Joker will just disappear and never come back. In fact, it is not far fetched to assume that the Joker will be the villain of the game.

The only thing that could make the Joker disappear is if the story is just one big ruse. As we saw in Arkham City, the Joker can be incredibly convincing. The idea that the Joker is not dead, but is actually still alive, is a realistic possibility.",0
"I'm not really one to begrudge people for thinking this. Not to mention, it would give more weight to the fact that the writers/directors have no idea at all about what makes a ""good"" story. They just put the Joker, Batman, and a bunch of other stuff together and said ""it's probably going to be like this."" I mean, it could have been the most boring, meaningless, pointless, generic ""Batman runs into a villain who ends up dying/getting killed/solving his own problems/finding a cure"" story ever told, but they went with it.",0

"There are a lot of things that can make a guy's masturbatory experience better

1) A partner that knows what she wants and can communicate it to you.  When I have a girlfriend that wants me to use a vibrator on her, she talks to me and I listen.  She doesn't feel like I'm doing her a disservice by doing it, though sometimes I think about the fact that her wanting me to use a vibrator on her actually helps to make it better.

2) A woman who knows what she wants and can communicate it to you.  When I have a girlfriend that is interested in masturbating, but doesn't know exactly what she wants, I think about what she wants and then make sure that I help her achieve it.  For example, if she wants me to wear a condom, I might make sure that she wears the condom.  If she doesn't, I might talk her into wearing a condom.

3) The woman's own masturbation routines.  I have a girlfriend who is a pretty big fan of masturbation.  I can't say much more than that, because I don't really know what she masturbates to.  She would like to masturbate to various things, and there are a lot of different things that she might like.  But if I could just say that I would like it if she masturbated to different kinds of porn.  That way, when she watches porn, she can imagine having sex with different kinds of guys and there's more variety and excitement.

4) The woman's own masturbation routines.  It's actually really exciting to see a woman who knows exactly what she wants and doesn't just say it.  I'm a bit of a big fan of the ""do it yourself"" thing and I'm kind of worried that if I just say that it will just be ""so much effort.""  I know that I'm going to feel like a jerk if I just say it, but I still want to make sure that I'm doing her a disservice if she just says it.",0

The detective investigating starts to suspect the other detective, but he is too afraid for his job to actually say any of this, because he is afraid of being fired, so he tries to cover it up.  Eventually the detective realizes that he is wrong and starts to investigate the other detective who is now the biggest suspect in the murder.  The detective who was the one who planted the evidence in the first place is fired, with the detective who was the most likely suspect being released.  That detective decides to go and investigate it, but is too scared to actually do it, because he knows that he will be fired, and will have to work for the police again.  At some point the detective who planted the evidence is released too by the detective who is investigating the murder, but the detective who was the most likely suspect is still jailed and has not been released yet.",0

"**Fargo** (1996).  This movie has a lot of great scenes that I don't think gets enough recognition.  It has some of the strongest performances in the movie.  The film is a very dark, depressing drama.  I also remember some of the funniest scenes, maybe due to the movie being made in the 70's.  Also is a very good movie to listen to while driving.  I really like how this movie doesn't feel like a typical crime movie.  It's very different and has a lot of humor and humor.

"**Kramer vs Kramer** (1982)

I've never been a big fan of comedies. After a couple of years of not seeing comedies on television I was bored af. I watched this new show on Netflix and boy was it not what I expected. It's not the sort of film you'd expect from the Coen Bros. and I was completely engrossed the entire time. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well crafted it was. I don't think any of the characters are written in a way that doesn't seem contrived. I really like the story and I think there's a certain honesty to the way the story is told. Also the soundtrack is fantastic. Everything is so perfectly crafted to my liking. The acting is also very good and the writing is well written and the characters are believable. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of Coen Bros.  I think it's a very well written comedy. **10/10**

**The Wackness** (2016)

I'm always surprised by how many people like this film. I love how it is so unlike anything else. It's quite dark and disturbing but in a different way than I'm used to. I liked it so much more than I expected it to be. It's not a comedy. It's a sad and intense drama. You get the sense that it's about two people trapped in the same body. It's about the lengths a person will go to in order to try to escape from their problems. I really like it. **8/10**

**Grave Of The Fireflies** (1988)

I really liked this film. It's a really sad and depressing movie that doesn't try to hide it's themes. It's a great movie. It's not a comedy. It's a film that makes you angry. It's the perfect film to watch at night. It's not a funny movie. It's a film that makes you feel things. I loved it. **9/10**",0

"To answer the first part of your question, it's possible to find the slope of a curved line by first taking the slope of the line itself, which is essentially the slope of the curve. Then, using the slope of the line, find the slope of the curve by adding two constants. If there are only two constants, then the slope of the curve is the slope of the line. If there are three constants, the slope of the curve is the slope of the line + the slope of the line.

The second part of your question concerns the relationship between two similar continuous curves. The answer is essentially the same, but the process is a little more involved.

The first step is to choose a point on the curve and determine its location on the curve with respect to the curve's origin. To do this, you need to choose a point on the curve, and to do this, you need to find its location on the curve relative to the origin. This is done using the formula for the area under a curve. Once you have this, you can use the formula for the area of a rectangle with side length 1, which is basically the formula for the area of a rectangle with side length 1. This is done by multiplying by the area of the rectangle.

Now that you have three constants, you can use the following formula to find the slope of a curve, which is the slope of the line.

s(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1/x^2 + 1/x + 1/x^2 + 1/x + 1/x^2 + 1/x - 1/x^2 + 1/x + 1/x^2 + 1/x - 1/x + 1/x^3 + 1/x + 1/x^2 + 1/x + 1/x^4 + 1/x + 1/x^2 + 1/x + 1/x + 1/x^2 + 1/x)

The slope of the line is a constant, so you can use this formula to find its slope, which is a constant too.",0
"You can use the slope of a curve of variable length, which is the slope of a straight line. To show it, draw the line you want to graph and then note that the slope of this line is the same as the slope of the curve.

In this case, since the slope of the line is the same as the slope of the curve the line is called a ""circular"" line.

To do the math, take the slope of the line with respect to the radius, and divide the sum of the slopes of the lines in the radius by this value to get the slope of the curve.",0
"What makes you think that the slope of a curve is a number that depends on all of the variables?

The slope is a *quantification* of *the slope of the curve in the graph*. If you have a graph with one variable, and another variable, and a third variable, that does not make the number of variables depend on the length of the graph.",0
"You can have a continuous curve and a ""bouncing"" one",0
"The length of the curve is just a way to represent the number of variables. The slope of a curve is just the slope of one variable. For example, in a graph of the slope of one variable, it is the same as the slope of the variable with the highest value.",0
"Let's look at the graph again.  

If you want a good idea of what slope looks like, look at the graph at the bottom of the page. The ""slope"" is the length of the curve on that graph.",0
"You can't really derive it.  It's just a rule of thumb.

Sine of a slope is the length of the curve divided by the length of the curve. 

Length of a curve is the length of the curve divided by the length of the curve.

The length of a curve is the sum of the lengths of the curves. The slope of a curve is the length of the curve divided by the length of the curve.

It is about following the commands of God.  It is a command to be obedient to God.  We are told to be good stewards of the world and to care for others as God would want us to.

I remember that most people could barely do proofs. I took a couple of classes over the summer with a professor who was pretty good, but he could barely do proofs. So, there's that.

At any rate, there is a norm of what you can get. I mean, there is a norm of what you can do. I think that most majors at the university of Michigan can get a B- or better in the hardest classes.

I think that a lot of people (not just math majors) will be satisfied with an average of a B- or better. A B+ is quite good. And, it's not a big deal at all. But, the important thing is if you can do it. If you can't do it, you should drop out.

I don't know the degree, but I think that most math majors can get a A or (at my university) a B+ in the hardest classes. I think that most people can get a B+ in the hardest classes.

And, it's not that you can't do it, it's that you can't do it, even if you wanted to. But, if you are a math major, you can get a B+ on some of the hardest courses.

It's pretty normal, you know?",0

The only thing you can do is talk to him. Just say you're still in a weird emotional/mental place and you need someone to talk to. You don't have to try to make him feel better but try to at least get him to open up to you.

Honestly, a lot of your issues stem from the fact that you're still hurting from the break up. He broke up because he wanted to go out and have fun, and you were going out to try to make some sort of connection. You both made a mistake in that you thought you could fix it but you didn't, so now you're both alone and sad.

I know it's going to be hard because you've already gone through so much, but try to find a way to help him. He probably feels like it's easier to talk to you than it would be to talk to you alone.

It's still a mystery why he killed so many people. Was he a career criminal? Was he just angry and sad?,0
"I am curious if you are familiar with the case of the ""Cali Four"", a group of four people who were charged and convicted of murdering a man in San Francisco.

As I understand it, the men are all immigrants (Mexican, Iranian, and Canadian) and they were all born in the US.

"I think the only reason he was sent to death was because he was a sex offender.  He was a registered sex offender, which is why he was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assaults against a child.  

He was also sent to death because he was a black man, and black men are considered dangerous by society.  The death penalty is a lot less costly and less racist than other punishments when you consider the amount of resources that are sunk into the legal system.  The death penalty in this case might have been more cost efficient than life imprisonment.

I think your theory is somewhat on the mark, but I believe there are some other factors at play as well, or at least, a lot more than just the death penalty.",0
I believe he was released due to a mistake being made by the sheriff and the sheriff had no idea that he still was alive. If you read the actual article it shows him being released when he realized he was still alive.,0

"I have a very clear memory of when I was about 9 years old. I remember sitting on my bed, watching TV. This house was pretty well furnished. There was always a TV on in the living room, but it was usually on a different channel. As the show was about to start, I noticed the TV was on my bed. I was so excited. I had finally achieved my childhood dream.

​

My mom had been having a very bad day. We were having a dinner party for the kids, and I was the only one there. It was probably the 2nd time that week that she had been very mad at me. At one point, she just got up to go upstairs, and when she came down, she yelled at me for being up all night watching TV. I didn't think much of this, but that was the end of my memory of that day. I don't think I ever remembered the TV.

​

​

I grew up in an area that is very rural, but there weren't too many houses around so I didn't see much of the outside world. I had a very good relationship with my mom. She was the most loving parent I knew, and I can only imagine her feeling when I was so excited about this TV watching thing. I don't know what was causing my excitement. Maybe it was her mood, maybe I was just really curious about the TV. I don't really know, but I know that it wasn't something that happened to me often.",0

"I'll try to be as concise as possible:

Most people think of the government as something you pay into. The government is there to provide you services. It is not there to steal from you. You pay into it, you get services.

In tax, the government is there to steal from you.  By stealing from you, they essentially take from you the services you paid for. This means that they are now paying you back for services you never received.

This is the problem with the current system. It is not incentivizing people to have high earning careers; they are simply not incentivized to do so.",0
"I think an important part of this question is that you're defining ""fair"" as ""unfair"". If you want to get an idea of the degree of unfairness, you can take a look at the income tax rates for the top 1% of people.

"> I do want to eliminate income tax completely but I'm not sure how to do it.

The income tax is a tax on your labor. You are taxed on the value you create. How can you have your own wealth when its being taxed? If you have no savings, you have to use your income to spend on necessities, which in turn adds to the tax burden. 

> I believe the current system incentivizes those who earn a lot less than a certain amount of income to keep going to college or get a graduate degree and thus get a huge amount of money from taxes.

This is not true. Most people don't get any tax dollars from taxes. If you're not working for a company, you don't have any ""extra"" money coming in. In fact, it's almost impossible to get anything from the government.

> I feel like I have a lot of my hard earned money going to the government and I'm not really able to use it for other purposes. I'm also not really able to save for a future and I'm really afraid that my hard earned money won't last long as taxes are so high.

This is not true. In fact, the government has some of the lowest taxes in the world.",0
"Here is a little intro to what a progressive tax is. It looks like this. http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1yc9x3/progressive_tax_vs_regressive_tax/ 

It is designed to give more tax breaks to the wealthy and less to the poor. So basically, your money goes to your pockets more.",0
"First, I'm not in favor of any kind of income tax. I'm merely pointing out that many people who do make more than the current level of income tax are able to pay taxes with no issues. Furthermore, many people who make a lot more than the current level of income tax choose to defer income taxes by paying them on their way out of the office.

In the US, I've never heard of anyone who pays taxes on their way out of the office.",0

">The network's coverage — which has focused on the Mueller report and the Trump-Russia probe as its highest ratings event of the day — is also drawing criticism from the right for its failure to dig deeper into the report.

So not only did they report the facts, the facts were on the right's side, so no complaints from them.",0
">Mueller's investigators are looking at thousands of pages of Trump-related documents, and several sources familiar with the team's efforts told CNN that they are preparing a criminal referral against the president that will likely make its way to a grand jury.

Wait. What? Did they say they are investigating documents related to Trump? A criminal referral is exactly the opposite, and is a way for prosecutors to argue that there is probable cause to present a case to a grand jury.",0

What? I've been watching UFC lately and I find it pretty entertaining. I thought you were the one with the problem because it was at the top of /r/MMA.,0
"For me it's been the same as the rest of the world. I think it is a combination of the old-school sport of boxing and it's associated ego-manipulating bullshit, the general ""lifestyle"" of the fighters and all the bullshit media that portrays it like a sport. The media portrays a story that is more interesting and exciting than the reality, so people are left with a negative image of the sport and not necessarily a positive one, which creates the negativity around it. 

I think the best thing you can do is to not pay attention to the negativity and instead focus on the positive aspects of the sport. The sport is a great way to get in shape, learn self discipline, become closer to God or whatever, and also it is a way to bond with other people from around the world. If you focus on all of the positive aspects of the sport, you will begin to realize it is really not that bad. If you focus on the negative aspects, you will also realize that they are unnecessary, because your perception is based on the negative aspects. 

I think you can still take the negative aspects and improve yourself to become a better person and the sport will benefit from it.",0

"So what's the plan here. I'm guessing we're going to send our military to help with the military situation in Mexico, and now they want to help with immigration.",0
"Well, I am not sure that is the most accurate word for it. What is actually happening is a very limited military operation. The military has been in the region for a while and it is already being used for a very small number of missions. They are not going to open up any major operations, but their presence is certainly not going to be used to ""help"" migrants.

The US has been a country that has had a policy of not sending soldiers into other countries for a very long time. They sent them to Europe for the most part because they felt that European countries would be the best option to deal with the refugee crisis. This is one of the reasons the US got so involved in Afghanistan and Iraq.

I think this is also why they sent so many to the Middle East and have been trying to get more troops into Africa. They hope that they can deal with the migration crisis and the refugee crisis by sending more troops to the Middle East, but the country is currently in a recession. So I would be more inclined to say that helping migrants is a good thing, but it is going to be a very small number of troops who are going to be sent to help migrants, so it is not going to be a large number of troops who are going to be helping migrants, and they are going to be fighting a war in a country that is very unstable.",0

A cell is the most basic building block of life. A cell is a self replicating cellular machine. Reproduction is essential for life itself but it is not the only essential function.,0
"The purpose of life is reproduction, yes, but it has more than that, a purpose beyond the basic reproduction of cells: the purpose of life is the creation of life, therefore, the purpose of life is to make life. It doesn't matter that reproduction occurs in nature (and in animals, the basic reproductive process that the scientific method defines can occur in nature with the right conditions, as in the case of the oviduct). 

When animals go extinct, they never really stop reproducing. They just stop reproducing with each other. It's why the first ""life"" is so much more interesting than the second, for example, because it's the first in a long line of life and thus represents the first in a long line of life. 

> It is the most basic reason for an organism to exist.

But can it not exist by other means? Could it be not only reproducing, but also evolving, improving, reproducing in some way other than reproduction, like intelligence or consciousness, or creativity? 

I'm not trying to say that reproduction is the most important aspect of life, but if you're living your life to reproduce, the purpose of life is reproduction. 

EDIT: And then you have to ask yourself, ""What is the purpose of life if it's to reproduce?""",0
"If I understand you correctly, one of the major goals of life is to reproduce. So then does the purpose of life not have the goal of reproduction?",0
"What you're saying is that the purpose of life is reproduction.

But if that's the case, then I think you'd be hard pressed to find a single purpose in life that isn't also reproduction.  In fact, I'd say that the only purpose in life is reproduction, for this reason.",0
"We evolved to live a specific way.

We evolved to have sex, to have children, to pass on our genes.

We evolved for these purposes.

If we didn't have these functions, we would not be alive.",0
"> It is the most basic function of life. It is the most basic purpose of any complex organism. It is the most basic reason for an organism to exist.

Yes, reproduction is the function of life, but life isn't the purpose of life. Reproduction can be the purpose of life, but not life.

There isn't a single purpose of life. It's a process. A process that happens to have the function of reproduction as one of its many tasks. Life is an emergent property of the universe's processes. We are the result of those processes.

Life is not the purpose of life.

> The purpose of life is reproduction. The meaning of life is reproduction.

Doesn't matter, the purpose of life is reproduction. Reproduction is the most basic purpose of life.",0
"So, when you say reproduction is the most important function of life, what exactly are you referring to? The ability to reproduce? If so, do you think it should be used as a means to ""make humans better""?

Or are you saying that reproduction is the most important aspect of life? Why?

The most important aspect of life is the ability to *have fun.* If you are happy with what you are doing, why do you need to reproduce?",0

I looked at her, shocked and tried to explain to her what she just said but she wouldn't listen. I got up and left because I got scared and couldn't figure out what was going on. It got to the point where I would wake up in the night and ask my mom if she was home, and she would tell me she was cooking breakfast. I'm not sure if it was a side effect or something else.

"The short answer is that both.  In addition, a lot of people who call themselves ""libertarian"" are just people who have an affinity for the word and are ignorant if anything about what it means and what it was meant to mean.

I'm a libertarian and I've read the FAQ a bunch of times.  The original definition was not a movement.  It was simply a word to describe people who didn't want a government that is big and intrusive.  The word has become a catch-all for the people who think government is bad.  Most of the time it's not the actual definition, but people misusing the word as the ""right"" or ""left"" side of the political spectrum.

I've never heard the word ""libertarian"" used to mean any of those things, and I've never come across that interpretation of the word.  I've heard it used to mean ""individualist"" or ""anarchist"" but those usually don't encompass the same things as the original meaning.

It's a catch-all because people misusing the word have no real definition.

The original word had two meanings.  One was ""not under a government"" and one was ""not under the government"" or ""not under authority"".  The two meanings are not mutually exclusive.",0

In my opinion, it is a movement with some core principles that are really important. I think a lot of people see the ""liberty"" part and assume that all libertarians are like this, but that's not true. I have a feeling that a lot of other people also see the ""individual liberty"" part and see the ""minorities' rights"" part and believe that all libertarians are like that.

You probably don't even need to look inside the box anymore, you are going to look on the ground and at the things around you. 

Once you have decided where you want to use your stash, I recommend that you do a deep dive of it. I found my stash under my floor mat in a baggie, I would like to take pictures of it but I will wait a couple days for my camera.

Yes. I find it so incredibly dumb to see people complaining about dystopian or dystopian-ish movies when we're all living in a dystopian world. It's like complaining when you go to the movies to see a horror movie and they show a horror movie in a realistic setting. It's so incredibly silly to complain when people watch a movie from a realistic setting.,0

You mean movies set in a dystopian future?

You might also want to consider that the same people that are against dystopia enjoy it (if they enjoy the idea of dystopia).",0

It sounds like you are on the same page and want the same thing with the same goal in mind. I would recommend you do a little more research on the things you want to try. Also, you need to let him know you are open to new things and want to be open and honest about your desires. Communication is the key to a healthy relationship.",0
"Just to take the edge off the ""this is impossible!"" posts:

1. I know a lot of this is dependent on what your definition of ""work"" is. I personally believe that if you can't be in the mood and you're not actively doing something to get yourself into the mood, you're not working.

2. To make him cum, you have to take that pleasure in yourself. For example, you need to tell him you're wet and you want it. You need to tell him the sexiest bit of sexual pleasure you can think of. You need to make him feel good about himself.

3. You have to make him feel special. That means you're making it about you. You don't need to be ""special"" to him, so be open about your feelings if you want to make him feel special.

4. Some people find orgasms really difficult to get. If you can't get him off, maybe you didn't have him too relaxed yet. Try to relax him when you start. 

5. Some people don't like to be touched. It's okay to be non-touchy. Acknowledge that you want to touch him and show him that you're there for him. 

6. If you're both too focused on the orgasm, maybe the guy was just too focused on keeping himself hard. Try to let him know that when you're wet, it's because you're attracted to him.

7. The ""I'm so turned on"" thing is a good way to show him that you're into it for him. If you tell him you're so turned on that you're doing it for him, he'll know that's exactly what you're doing.

I hope this answers your question! Good luck!",0
"First off, if you are looking for new things, try looking up stuff on Fetlife.",0
"I'll preface this by saying that I have a relatively low libido and my husband and I both like to be very very quiet about it. I'm not sure if it's because of how I look or because I've never been with anyone who could have a high libido. So maybe it's a mix of that and the fact that I'm afraid of being loud in front of my husband. My husband and I get super into our sex life and really enjoy all the different types of sex we have. One of my favorite things about sex is it's a great way to bond with someone, so if I'm getting into the mood I want to get my partner as much involved in making it happen as I can. We've had sex on a couple of occasions where I've been super loud, and it's always really awkward and uncomfortable for him. So I've had to learn to dial it back. I want to be the one who does the talking, and usually my husband is very good at listening.

I think the best way for us to get into the mood is for him to give me a massage or massage in general. In our case it's him taking me from the start and the back massage is very sexy for him. I'll usually have my legs spread wide and he comes in me. If I'm so turned on that I don't care if I'm being loud, I'll tell him to be quiet and then turn into him. If I'm having trouble keeping quiet, I usually don't want my husband there at all and will ask if he wants me to call my husband and tell her to be quiet. Sometimes I'll tell him I want him to come in me and he'll be super excited to know that I want him inside me. I'm sooo turned on that I'll ask him if we can change positions and he'll love it so much. 

I'd suggest that we just get into it. I love sex and I know that he loves sex and I want to make sure that he's enjoying it with me. 

I hope that goes well for you.",0
"I've only been with my SO for about two months but we have discussed having kids and new things to try. It's been great and I look forward to doing all of them with him. I'm not too sure about the anal because I haven't done it yet so please don't assume that you need to do it first.

I was thinking of trying anal for the first time as well, but that's a lot of talking and I'm trying to get him to really get into it as well. 

My SO has a pretty high sex drive and I think that's what's holding us back. I can't wait to watch him cum!",0
Punisher's greatest strength is his ability to put things back the where they were.  No means no.,0
"The Punisher is an expert marksman and has no qualms about going up against a group of armed thugs.  Not only that, but he also has access to his arsenal which is a large amount of firearms ranging from shotguns to pistols to assault rifles.

If Batman had all his gadgets he can probably take the Punisher down in the streets.  His gadgets are not without drawbacks and a lot of the times he must make use of his bare hands and face injury to do so.

If he wanted to take him down, he can get a gun and point it at the Punisher and pull the trigger.",0
"He's gonna need a lot of time to kill Bruce without being detected, and I don't think he's going to find a way to do that without killing himself.",0

"As much as I love the Punisher, and I really do, the only real problem I have with him is his endurance. He could probably fight Batman for a while, but if he is constantly using his gadgets, he would eventually tire out.",0
"Punisher is probably the weakest guy in the DC universe, and he has an arsenal of weapons.  He's a pretty good fighter, but is pretty weak when it comes to direct physical combat.  He also can't really tank any of Batman's attacks.

So, I'd say that Batman does pretty well.  If Batman was in a place with more weaponry, his punches would probably be enough to knock him out, but I think that's not the case.  He can't really take Punisher down.",0
"The Punisher has a pretty poor track record in this series. Punisher is a highly trained professional killer, but has no training in martial arts and has never beaten Batman, much less beat him in a fight. He is a better shot, and a better marksman, but lacks the ability to throw punches. 

He would be hard to take out, if he is not constantly trying to kill Batman. Batman is just too smart, and has too many advantages.",0
The Punisher gets killed by Batman or otherwise gets his equipment stolen/broken.,0
"Punisher is a lot better at taking out single enemies than Batmans. Punisher has taken out super soldiers and trained assassins, and Batman is still fighting those enemies. Batman has a lot of tools that can help him win, but the Punisher does not.

Punisher wins 9/10 times, because he has a lot of gadgets and can kill people while they're not looking.",0

"Because the ""h"" sound is the ""rh"" sound (rhinitis in old English).

A ""nigga"" has a ""n"" sound because it is a contraction of the word for the ""nigga"" part of an old African American dialect of English.

""Nigga"" -> ""Nigga"" -> ""Nigga""

""Nigga"" -> ""Nigga"" -> ""Nigga""",0
"In Afrikaans there's the word ""nigger"" or ""niger"" which comes from the same root as ""niger"" (nigger) in the Nahuatl language. This word is used as a racist term in the South African South African language and is often referred to as ""nigger"" in Afrikaans. However, it's the German word ""niger"" (niger) which is a cognate of the English word ""nigger"" (nigger) in the same way ""Afrikaans"" is a cognate of ""English"" in the same way ""African American"" is a cognate of ""African"" in the same way ""English"" is a cognate of ""German"" in the same way ""Italian"" is a cognate of the English word ""gringo"" in the same way ""French"" is of the English word ""français"" so ""niger"" is a cognate of the English word ""nigger"" in Afrikaans. In Afrikaans it's a slang word meaning ""nigger""",0

"Hi! The first thing to know is that the podcast only shows the tip of the iceberg. That's what the episode itself is about, so I'll try and provide some context.

​

As you may know, the DNA identified by the lab that performed the DNA analysis was not the killer. The DNA was from a crime scene that was not included in any of the forensic evidence. That means that the suspect(s) could have been anywhere in the world. 

​

We know that a man was arrested in an airport, and that he was found in a different country. There is no evidence to suggest that he was the killer. 

​

The police still have the DNA of both murders, but do not have it. They've sent it to the lab in the hopes of finding a match. If there is a match, the investigation will be re-opened, and the suspect(s) will be arrested. 

​

The man who was arrested in the airport is a member of a known crime family in Sweden. He may be a suspect in one of the cases, but is not the one who committed the other one. The families are not connected, but there is some suspicion that he could be the one who committed the other case, which would make him a suspect in both cases. It's also possible that he is completely innocent, and that he was just arrested to obtain more information on the crime.

"The answer is not the value of the number, but the probability of choosing that number. The question is asking for a probability in the number.",0
"> The value of a number in a math problem is the number of possible math problems that can be solved with that number in them, divided by the number of possible math problems that can be solved with that number in them.

The math problems that are solved are called ""solutions to the problem."" So if there are 1,000,000 solutions to the problem, then the value of a number in a math problem is the number of possible solutions to the problem.

> In other words, the value of a number is the number of problems it can solve.

This is a bit complicated to explain in a simple way, but it's the same thing.

For example, if you were trying to find the value of 1/2 of a million, or 1/2 of a billion, or 1/2 of a trillion, or 1/2 of a billion, or 1/2 of a trillion, or 1/2 of a quadrillion... then you would have 1/2 of these problems, so this number would be the value of 1/2 of these problems.

If you were trying to get the value of 1/2 of a million, or 1/4 of a million, or 1/4 of a billion, or 1/4 of a quadrillion... then you would have 1/2 of these problems, so this number would be the value of 1/2 of these problems.

These kind of problems are called ""problems.""",0
This is a great one.,0
"I can't even get a proper answer out of that Q.

I can see that there's value in a number in some math problem.  But, I can't see how that makes the number ""valuable"".

The most interesting part of a math problem is not the solutions.  And, even in that, it's not the value of the number that's important, but how we arrived at a solution.  So, in an equation, the question is: What is the value of a number in the equation?

"* **NIN** - *In This Moment* (2008): For years, ""Where's My Face When You're Gone"" has been the most memorable NIN song for me. Now I have the opportunity to listen to it first-hand, and it's a good one. 

The production is so much better, and the drums and guitars are just so satisfying. It really feels like the band has matured from their first album, and I expect them to take it to another level on their next one.

* **NIN** - *The Fragile* (2008): The sound is more subdued than the previous album, and it's mostly just Trent singing about his life as he goes through what he describes as a ""perfectly normal"" summer. I thought it was a little weak, but a lot of the songs on this album are fairly strong.

* **NIN** - *In A Silent Way*, (2010): This is where all the ""what the fuck is this"" moments come from. Trent's lyrics and style of singing are so much better than on *The Fragile.* It's also one of my favorite albums of the decade.

* **NIN** - *Misery Business*, (2012): I can't decide if this album is an ""upgrade"" or ""downgrade."" There are some moments that are so brilliant they make the best of the previous album and some moments that just sound like someone just lost a lot of weight. I'm not sure I've ever been so invested in a song.

* **NIN** - *The Slip* (2013): The band has finally found their sound, and it's pretty fucking great. So much so that I'm not sure why they haven't just released another album with this sound.

* **NIN** - *No Quarter* (2015): I think this was supposed to be a ""sequel"" to *Misery Business,* but I was so disappointed with this album that I can't help but wonder if they actually didn't want to do a sequel.

"**RISE OF THE EMPEROR** - Rise of the Emperor is an American black metal band formed in 1992 in San Diego, California. The label Rise of the Emperor Records was first released on December 31, 1992.


The band features the vocalist/guitarist/composer/drummer/bassist/keyboardist/electric guitarist/filler drummer/mixer/producer/engineer/engineer/mixer/engineer/filler drummer.

The band consists of 3 members. The vocals are performed by Jason Pierce (vocals), Kevin MacLeod (vocals), and Eric Smith (guitar and vocal).

In addition to the vocals, the band features the guitarists Paul Hall (lead guitar), John Haughton (lead bass), and Mike Lalli (drums) with additional backing by the drummer.

The band was formed after Haughton left an earlier band (The Dead Kennedys). The band began around the same time that The Dead Kennedys dissolved and formed their own label, Rise of the Emperor Records.

As the album is about his struggles with depression and self-doubt, so to can the song reflect on the themes of his personal issues.

As a bonus, I thought it was a good song to use for my last show of the year. It's like a very gentle, introspective song that I can just sit and listen to. I'm going to be playing the rest of the album this week in the house too, and I think the track will help me out.",0

The entire album is recorded in the style of Grateful Dead jams, with a lot of improvisation and a lot of weird song choices.  
  
One of the songs on the album, ""The Other One,"" is a collaboration between Garcia and drummer Bill Kreutzman.  The song includes vocals from both Kreutzman and Garcia.  
  
The other songs on the album are as diverse as the band, and include a couple of other Grateful Dead members, a blues singer, and a sax player.

I love Slipknot and the reason why has to do with the band's unique and memorable sound, the fact that Slipknot has been active for longer than most other bands, the fact that every album is worth seeing.

Slipknot is a metal band that has been around since the early 1990's and in my opinion the best metal band ever. Their sound sounds very different from most other rock bands and they make very unique and creative metal songs.

Their best album is probably *The Slip* and it's only 4 songs long. It's a good album with unique, catchy metal songs and some good lyrics.

"**Kanye West** - *Yeezus*

The album and subsequent tour are a personal high watermark in my life. I've never been a Kanye fan, but I feel so much more connected to his music now than I did four years ago. He is still an amazing musician, but I feel like he's become more and more human. And I feel like he's been able to transcend his own struggles with fame and ego. I loved the Kanye West of ""I Am a God"" and ""FML"" to see the human side of him. I think he's made a truly profound impact on the world and I'm glad he's in my life.",0

"I would imagine that the Punic wars were a major factor in how Rome was able to continue as a world power for centuries. There are two things that I would think would have been responsible for keeping the empire together. The first is the fact that Rome had an extensive network of trade, which allowed the empire to survive. The second was the fact that Rome could have lost the Carthaginians if it didn't manage to hold onto a large portion of the empire.

Rome has had a fairly stable power structure since at least the early Republic, and there are many examples of Roman emperors using their position to protect their subjects from outside threats. This is seen, for example, in the case of Romulus, when a group of barbarian leaders threatened Rome in the early 2nd century BC. The Romans, however, were able to hold onto their empire thanks to their ability to mobilize great numbers of troops and, more importantly, to be able to bribe powerful people in exchange for protection. Without such protection, the Roman empire would likely have fallen apart into competing factions.

With regards to the Carthaginians, they were certainly not a threat to Rome, but they were a major threat to Carthage. Rome used the Punic Wars to keep the Carthaginians out of North Africa, and they were unable to do this because of the Carthaginians.

One final note: Rome never lost the power to control the Italian peninsula due to the Carthaginian Wars. Although there was a period of instability in the empire, the entire Roman empire was able to maintain a strong foothold in the Italian peninsula thanks in large part to the Punic Wars.",0
"It's important to note that the Punic Wars were fought over a few issues. First, Carthage was making their own allies and enemies of the Romans after years of being a client state, but the Romans were also fighting with their own allies. The Romans were fighting with Greeks, Gauls, and Italians, and these were also enemies of Carthage.

Also, the Punic Wars were fought by Rome when they were at its weakest. They were at war with most of the Mediterranean, and the Romans fought well to take Rome out of the war. When the Punic Wars were over, the Romans were re-energized, and ready to fight again, but not until they had a larger land empire.",0
"If you're interested in the political and military context within which the Punic Wars happened, I would highly recommend reading up on some of the books on the subject.

For a quick look at what was going on, I'd suggest a bit of [the history of Italy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Italy-By-Pippini-Dall'Or/dp/081293889X).

If you're interested in the physical impact of the Punic Wars on the Roman Empire, I suggest you read:

- [The Roman World in the Middle Ages](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Roman-World-Middle-Ages-Alfred-Cantos/dp/0812921902/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1385888462&sr=8-7&keywords=roman+world)

These should give you a good starting point.",0
"The Romans would have survived just fine but it is important to note that Rome's power did not completely evaporate. 

The Punic wars were a major setback to the empire but it was not the end. There is a lot of evidence that shows the Romans, and later Romans, were able to keep up a steady pace of technological innovation (see the *Aeneid* and the work of *Augustine* and *Gregory* in particular) and maintain the same level of economic productivity. They also maintained sufficient military power to defend Italy, Gaul and Spain. All this meant that the Romans could maintain their grip on the entire Mediterranean and keep the barbarian invasions to a minimum.

It's important to remember that the Romans were far wealthier than the average citizen of the empire. While most people were living in peasant-labour ghettos (like in Italy, Gaul and Spain), the Romans had a higher standard of living than many people in Europe.

The Roman Empire survived the Punic wars because it was able to adapt. Rome was not defeated by the barbarians but by other barbarian states in the Mediterranean. 

The Romans did not go away completely but they did go from having one of the largest and most powerful empires in the world to being a mere regional power (and never truly a global power) within a century.",0
"To answer your question, the Punic Wars were only a minor nuisance to the Romans. By the time of the Punic Wars, the Roman Empire had become very wealthy. This wealth is largely due to the empire's ability to conquer new lands and to extract a tribute from conquered peoples. If the Romans were to lose these territories, they would be in dire straits. On the other hand, the Roman Empire was able to maintain its wealth and power by absorbing the conquered peoples' wealth and power. The Punic Wars did not affect the Roman economy as much as it did the empire's wealth and power.  The Romans also had a very effective military and were able to sustain a large military force which allowed them to make quick marches to the front to fight off any impending threats.

"A few things. First, the Romans were, by all accounts, at a low point politically and economically. They had had centuries of warfare with other cultures that had left them with a very bad reputation. So, when the opportunity presented itself, they would have been open to it. Furthermore, they had little to no influence over Carthage and its rulers.

Secondly, it's hard to really know what made a successful Rome. The Greeks and the Persians were at war with each other in the eastern Mediterranean and so the Romans had to take care of business. At the same time, their empire was in no position to challenge the Persians or the Greeks themselves. In addition, Rome had been weakened by the years of war and the loss of their colonies in Africa. They were in no position to truly challenge Carthage as a competitor.

Thirdly, the Punic Wars did not end Rome's influence as a power. Rome was still powerful enough to threaten Carthage. That does not negate Rome's position in the Mediterranean.

The real problem was that the Romans were fighting a war against the Greeks in Asia Minor. It also had implications for the eastern Mediterranean. This was not a good situation for Rome and they had a lot to lose if they lost the wars. This was a time when they were not in a good position to compete.",0
"This is a question that is very tricky to answer, but ultimately, there is a few things to say.

First and foremost, the Punic Wars were a huge deal in antiquity, at least in terms of sheer numbers of deaths. But this is not really what we mean by ""survive"". The Romans were devastated by the war, but it didn't completely destroy the empire; there were also a number of other factors that allowed for Rome's long term survival, such as its economy, its navy and its culture (and the fact that by the time it was conquered by Carthage, the Roman empire hadn't really changed since the time of Augustus).

The answer to your question is ""how"". The Roman Empire survived the Punic Wars because it was largely a continuation of the Roman Empire that had existed since the 2nd century BC. The Roman army had been largely unchanged since the 2nd century BC, although it had evolved into the later empire as you noted. As you might know, this ""roman army"" was made up from the Roman military, so the Romans knew the military was good, and so they made sure to keep it.

The Romans also have a very sophisticated system of government and culture, which I'll touch on later.

Lastly, the Roman Empire survived the Punic Wars because it was still an empire. The Punic Wars were never truly the end of the Roman Empire, and the Romans always were a superpower, albeit a very old one.

The Punic Wars were really bad for the Romans and Carthage, but that doesn't mean that the Romans were destroyed by it.

The first step in preventing the death of Rome is to survive, and that, by and large, they succeeded in.",0

1. They wanted to avoid detection from sensors, and wanted to avoid detection from sensors.
2. They wanted to avoid detection from sensors.

The Dominion might have been trying to hide because their primary mission was to destroy the Federation. The Dominion would have had little incentive to deploy cloaks against a group which was just trying to build a new home planet for the Bajorans.,0
"The Dominion was in a position of a power in the quadrant they were fighting. Having cloaked ships was a viable and viable tactic. They could deploy cloaks when they were on the offensive. 


It's possible the Dominion were trying to hide the fact that they were there.",0
"I've always wondered, if you don't take cloaking devices to a war, what do you do to hide from the Klingons? Or the Romulans? They're basically all the other races with cloaks.",0
"I'm not entirely sure of the Dominion's reasons to deploy cloaking devices in the war. I do know that cloaking devices do not give the wearer a defense against the sensors of a Federation or Klingon ship.

It's really just a matter of figuring out the ratio of circumference to diameter.,0
"It's a bit of a problem that's pretty common. 

To simplify, imagine you're making a rectangle. You want to create a 2-dimensional line that connects the top of the rectangle to the bottom. This line is the radius of the rectangle.

Now, imagine you're making another rectangle of the same dimensions. You want to make the same line connecting the bottom edge of the two rectangles. This is the radius of the other rectangle. You can make that line by connecting the bottom edges of the rectangles. That way, you can create a line connecting the top edge of each rectangle with the bottom edge of the other rectangle.

Now, imagine you're making a 3-dimensional line that connects the top edge of the first rectangle to the bottom edge of the second rectangle. You want to create a line connecting the top edge of the second rectangle to the top edge of the first rectangle. You can make this line by connecting the top edges of both rectangles. That way, you can create a line connecting the sides of the second rectangle to the sides of the first rectangle.

So, it turns out that it's really easy to make a 3-dimensional line. But there's a limit to how many dimensions there are. You have an upper limit on the number of dimensions by making a line from the top of a 3-dimensional line to the top of a 2-dimensional line.

The more dimensions, the more lines you need to make. If you want to make a line with two sides, you have to make a line twice as long. If you want to make a line with four sides, you need a line three times as long.

So this means that you have to make a line at least three times as long as the radius of the rectangle, and probably much more.

In general, you need to make a line that has the same number of distinct points as there are dimensions. If there's just one dimension, you can ignore this.",0

"The theorem is pretty straightforward and you can find an infinite list of functions that satisfy it. But, there are more conditions to satisfy when you want to write your own functional equation.",0
"The ""essential theorem"" of calculus is actually a theorem of linear algebra. For example, the integral of a function over a closed interval is the integral of the function over the closed interval itself. Or, if the function is a bounded function, the integral of the function is the integral of its domain. Similarly, the integral of a function over a finite interval is the integral of the function over the interval itself.",0
"I don't think you're asking for a simple answer to this, moreso asking for a general answer. 

Yes, the condition is ""that the function has a z-distribution"". For instance, we can say that a function is continuous at a point if it satisfies some condition that is satisfied everywhere but not at any point. This is what is meant by ""having a z-distribution"".

But this isn't to say that, for example, f(a) is continuous at a point but the function f(a,b) is not. In that case, f(a,b) is not continuous at a point (in fact, we can't even say that f(a,b) is continuous without using some other condition, since it's not continuous at a point). 

The way to understand the conditions used in the theorem is that there is a sequence of points x1,...,xn where f(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,...,xn) is continuous at some x. But this sequence of points is also continuous at all of x1,...,xn. This means that the number of points where f is continuous depends on the number of points where f is also continuous. Thus, if no set of points is continuous at some point, the theorem proves that the set of points where f is continuous isn't.

This is why the theorem doesn't say that the function f(a) must be continuous at every point, but that it must be continuous for every finite number of points.",0
"It's true that the condition is that it must be continuous everywhere, but the condition is not the condition that is satisfied, but it's not the condition that is satisfied.

For example, let's say we want to define the function f(a) = (s,s',z') = (0,0,1). It's easy to show that this function is not continuous everywhere: f(0)=0, f(1)=1. But it's harder to see that the condition is satisfied: f(x)=0, f(x+1)=0.",0
"> The problem is that if a function is zero everywhere, at every point, and it has no z-distribution, it's not a function. Let me give you an example. Let's say that the function f(a) is zero everywhere and has an infinite z-distribution. If we were to call f(a) a function, it would be a counterexample of the theorem. So there is a condition that a function needs to meet in order to be a function.

To make it more clear, it is not a function if it has infinite z-distribution. A function is a function if it has a continuous z-distribution.

>I thought that this condition was the condition that it must be continuous. But as I read it, it is not the condition that it has to be continuous at every point. The condition is that it must be continuous everywhere.

The condition is that the function has to be continuous at all points, that is, at least one of the points. As you said, it has to have a continuous z-distribution.",0
"The condition is that it has to be continuous for each point.

And I think you can. Let f(x) be an (x,x') set of points. Then the inequality is f(x)=f(y)=f(z)=f(z')=f(z)f(x)=f(y)f(x')=f(x)f(x')'=f(x')f(x')'=f(x')f(x')=f(y)f(x)f(x').",0

The article is talking about a new tool to help parents track their children's breathing. It says nothing about what this new tool is being used for.

I just had a baby (6 months old) who is on a normal breath. This is amazing.,0
"I hate the term ""normal breath"" because it's a false definition of ""normal"". It's not normal to breathe through your nose. 

That's the only part of respiration that's ""normal"" in the sense that it's a good thing for the body. So the ""normal breath"" means ""healthy"" or ""normal"".

And it's not so much that it's hard to tell when your child is on a normal breath. It's that the only time it would be a good idea to know is when they're taking a really large breath. 

So I would say you should know when your child is on a healthy breath, but if you know that they're taking a really large breath, it's not a good idea to know.",0

"The Russian *colonization* of the Americas was a thing. It is also a thing that the U.S. government and the U.S. media have chosen to ignore or downplay. In the course of the last century, Russia has colonized many more countries in the form of the Tsarist Russian Empire, the Russian-Indian Treaty of 1857, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, and especially in the case of the latter, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. After that, they've managed to colonize all the former Russian-American colonies in the Caribbean and Latin America without much international opposition.

I'm not going to go into the reasons for this. It involves a lot of things: the ""proletarianization"" campaign by the Bolsheviks in 1919, the invasion of Afghanistan and the destruction of the ""Mujahadeen,"" and the occupation of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.

The end result from all this is that for over a hundred years, Russia has managed to occupy not only the Americas, but many parts of the British Empire, India, and Europe as well. The Russians had the ability to occupy Europe for decades, and they used that capability to annex as much of it as they could.",0

"""All Russian, all the time"" is a very good quote, though it's not entirely accurate. The Tsarist regime did not do anything to force people by force to convert to Orthodoxy, and it is entirely possible to have an un-Orthodox family in Russia (especially in smaller towns, where people mostly just go by their last names anyway). This is especially true for the poor and uneducated.

The Tsarist regime used its power to keep the population in line, though. ""All Russian, all the time"" meant that people had to remain obedient to the Tsarist regime and the Tsar and not rebel (or even speak out against the government), which meant that things like speaking out would probably just get you killed.",0

If the OP and the mods don't mind, I'd like to see all this thread's responses (as well as the ones from the other thread) archived (and with some sort of timestamp), so we can go back and look at some of those responses.

For the record, I'm not an anti-Russian person. I'm just curious as to how much of the anti-Russian sentiment is simply from people who don't know any better, and how much of it is people who don't know what they're talking about.",0

"There's also a great story about George Washington's carrots in the Book of Mormon, that probably didn't exist.

I'm going to copy/paste the relevant part of the story here from LDS.org:

>A man asked the Lord to send a carpenter to him whose work he could not complete, and who would not pay him, declaring that God would have something for him to do. The Lord, to his surprise, called a man in the city of New York named Abinadi, and said to him, ""Go to the City of Moroni, and I will send you a carpenter who will finish the work for you."" And so the man went to Moroni. And when he arrived, he went to the carpenter, and said to him, ""I cannot finish the work for you, and you refuse to pay me, and you claim that God has something for me."" The carpenter replied, ""I was about to give you, but the Lord restrained me."" And the man went back to the house of the Lord, and he found his wages due.",0
"It was well received, even today, and is seen as a ""classy"" thing to do to an old friend. Of course, this is the same country where we have ""happy hour"" and ""happy weekends"". A friend of mine who was in the US army in the military had a great laugh when I explained to him what happy hour meant.

As for the content, it isn't a bad film. For that matter, it's good content if the film is good. The story is good, and the characters are well developed and interesting. The acting is good too. The film is not perfect, by any means. There is some sloppy editing, but that doesn't take away from its qualities and makes the film more enjoyable because of it.

As for the cake, I'm not sure what the intent was. I think the intent was to be a bit of a joke, but I'm not sure.",0

I am currently preparing for a trip with a friend to a desert island in the Caribbean, which is supposed to take us about a week. I have a couple of things left to do before that, but I have to clean the house and prepare the food and my wife can't be bothered to do it.

"The article is great, but I'd like to highlight what they call 'data augmentation' - the process of combining previously unlabeled data with new data. 

For example, if you have two pictures of a dog sitting at a table, and a third picture of a dog sitting at a table with another dog on the table, you might have one picture labeled ""dog sitting at a table"" and another picture labeled ""dog sitting at a table with another dog on the table."" 

You might then label the other picture as ""dog sitting at a table with another dog on the table"" and the third picture as ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the table."" You might then label this picture as ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the dog"" and label the third picture as ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the dog."" You might then label the picture ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the dog and a dog."" You might label the picture as ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the dog and a dog on the dog."" You might label the picture as ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the dog and a dog on the dog and a dog on the dog"" and label the third picture as ""dog sitting at a table with a dog on the dog and a dog on the dog and a dog on the dog."" 

The point I was making is that you can use these kinds of data augmentation techniques to generate new pictures and labels for existing pictures in an entirely new way. This is how the machine learning approach of building a model that can learn to generate new pictures based on unlabeled data works. It's not a new idea.",0

"A man sat in the corner of the office. He was there since the arrival of Mr. Jones. The man had only been in the position for a mere four months, but his name was well known among the staff.

The man was the first manager to resign from the office after the new boss had come into power. He was a rather short man, with a thin beard, and a rather ugly face. The other staff were not a fan of him, but Mr. Jones loved his new hire, and he was the first manager to take the new job.

""I am so glad to have you on board. You'll do great! You'll definitely be the first manager to leave.""

""Thank you sir, I can't believe that I'm being hired as a manager. I have never had a manager before, and I will be so excited to work for you.""

The man shook his head, and left the office. The rest of the staff sat in the office, staring at Mr. Jones. He smiled and waved.

""Well, you're welcome, Mr. Jones. I'm glad that you have decided to go for a new job. Congratulations!""

""Thank you sir. But I was just thinking about my new job.""

""Oh? Is that all?""

""Well, I have no idea what you do, and I need to get to know you. But I'll make sure that you're happy and we'll start to learn together!""

Mr. Jones walked over to the man, and he hugged him. ""I'm glad I could help you. I really will make you a great manager!"" Mr. Jones raised his hands, and the man thanked him for his time.

""I hope you'll be a good boss.""

""I will be.""

""Thanks a lot!""

The man left the office, and Mr. Jones smiled.

""I will make sure that you'll have a great time on your first day.""

""Thank you sir! I really will!""

Mr. Jones clapped his hands, and walked away. The new manager of the office was introduced, and he too clapped his hands.

""Well, that was nice. Thanks for the time.""

""You're welcome. I'll be sure to get to know you!""

Mr. Jones left the office, and the other staff looked at the new manager.

""Wow, what a good job! Congratulations!"" Mr. Jones waved, and then left the office.

The new manager was introduced to the rest of the staff. The new manager nodded at each of them, and then he left the office. He left his new job with his new manager, and they were all left confused.

""What is he doing? What did he do?""

""He was introducing everyone to his new job, and he clapped each of us on the back.""

""What a great job!""

"""Hey, what's up?"" The newcomer asked me. ""What's going on, dude?""  
I'd heard rumors about him, of course. He was a bit of a weirdo, an eccentric. He seemed to be an odd case, but I saw him as a valuable addition to our staff. He was a great guy, a real down-to-earth type.  
""I'm just here to collect my paycheck, ya know?"" I replied.  
""Yeah, man. I gotta go, I have to go. You need anything?"" He nodded vigorously.  
""Not a problem, just let me know when you've finished collecting yours.""  
As I walked over to my desk and pulled my paycheck out of my vest, the newcomer took my hand and pulled me out to the lobby to meet up with the rest of the staff. He had an accent that I couldn't place, so my guess was that he was from the South. I didn't have time to ask, though, as we were soon joined by the rest of the staff, and a few other new ones.  
""Are you alright, man?"" The new guy asked. ""We got another guy coming in, and he's got a lot of trouble with his hands.""  
""No problem, just let me know when you've collected your pay and I'll take care of him."" I said as I closed the door and sat down to collect my paycheck.  
""Do you remember where that door is?"" The newcomer said.  
""Oh yeah, where is it?"" I laughed. ""It's on the way to my desk. Go get it.""  
The guy nodded, and as he walked out, he started talking, ""He's got some big hands, man.""  
""Hey, that's fine. It's what we need, man."" I said as I walked toward the door.  
""Hey, what's happening? This guy was supposed to come in tomorrow, but he's not showing."" The newcomer stood in the doorway looking confused. ""What the fuck?""  
""He went on a little bender with the others, man. He's got some anger issues."" I replied.  
""Are you sure he's okay?"" The newcomer seemed really worried. ""You really think he's okay?""  
""I think he's fine. I just need to go collect my paycheck. He's got a lot of anger issues, but he's got some good anger issues too. I'm sure he'll be fine. Just go collect your pay, I'll pay."" I said as I walked out the door, and as I walked down the stairs toward my desk, I heard the newcomer's confused shout.  
""You're going to pay him?""  
""Oh god no."" I said as I reached for the door.  
""Oh my god."" He said.  
""What the hell man, give me a sec!""",0
"""I'm back!"" She yelled, ""We've been waiting for you!""

""Is it too late to start the interview? He's a great guy, but you're not going to believe it, he's dying. He needs this job more than you do!""

The man's eyes opened, as the woman finished her sentence. Both were in their seventies.

""I'm sorry sir but that's not why I'm here. I'm here to interview people for the position of the new manager. Do you know the qualifications?"" I nodded.

""Oh, I see, you have the qualifications, but why the hell do you have to be here?"" The old man's voice was rising.

""I've been with the company for thirty years, I've interviewed for this job before, and when I was last here, our company was dying. Your company is still alive and well, and has grown in size exponentially. I think it's a good match, and your qualifications are perfect. So, it's finally time to talk to the next one.""",0

That's fine. Get stronger. As long as you get stronger in the form you're comfortable with and in the frequency you're comfortable with, go for it.

You can read a lot of stuff online but you also have to do things. Workouts are your friend.

> I am really new to the gym. So I want to start off with a barbell bench press.

This is probably the most important thing you need to get started. Don't use dumbbells.

> Is this a good idea to go about it?

It depends on your goals and what you're comfortable with.

> Are there any exercises to improve my grip?

You could do a couple of things. You could do deadlifts, which work your grip by strengthening your back. Or you could add something to the barbell like a chinup bar or a weighted pullup bar.

"You can try to find it. 

However, I don't think it is going to be all that hard. 

You can call your boyfriend and find out where he was. 

You can go to his work and ask him where he was. 

You can go to the bar and ask him if he dropped it off. 

You can go to a bar and ask any bartender. 

You can go to a bar and ask anyone working there. 

I'm sure there are multiple ways to do it. 

The police can't be involved. 

You can just ask your boyfriend to go to a bar and ask them. 

If you go to the place he was at by yourself, don't just leave without saying where you're going. 

You can try to just talk to him without having someone there with you. 

If he's really good to you, he'll get mad at you for asking. 

If he's not good to you, he'll have no problem telling you where he went. 

So, I think you're going to be fine, just go talk to him. 

Also, if you're worried about the phone, that's probably because of all the stress you have been under. If it were me, I'd probably be more concerned about it.",0
"I'm with you, I lost mine a few years ago. I was with my boyfriend at the time and I left my phone lying around in a store, and ended up with 2 new phones and I didn't know it, I had been in a relationship with him for a little over a year. I have a new phone now and I'm so grateful to him for that. I had to start a new job and it's a lot harder to get a new phone.",0

You might be able to find it and get it back, just don't say anything (because it's not your fault...) about it to anyone. If your child is older and knows and doesn't want it, you'll be fine and your child will learn to not be a danger to your phone. I would just get it back, call your boyfriend and tell him it's not where you found it (if it's at home) and ask him if it's okay to come in your room to look for it. Ask him if it's okay to call him back (you won't be able to tell him that it's at your place) if you can't find it. Ask him to let you know if he finds it. If he cannot find it, I'd say he is not at fault because he is not actively trying to do anything wrong, and he is not going to do anything illegal. Hope that helps.",0
"My only advice here is to tell your boyfriend that you dropped it. If he doesn't tell his friends to find the phone, you're better off not telling anyone and leaving it alone. 

Don't give it to anyone and see if you can't find it in a trash can or a trash dump. 

Also, be careful with the phone as it's not waterproof and the battery can die (and then you're screwed).",0

"You can run any game well on a laptop. What you need to do is get a laptop that has the graphics card that you want.

The best way to get one that has the graphics card you want is to buy a laptop from a store with the graphics card you want.

For example, you want a laptop with a GTX 660m, then you go to a store and they should have a laptop with that graphics card.

If you can't get one from a store, then you should check the laptop parts list on [this page](https://www.computerbase.de/en/laptops/laptops-parts/laptops/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/graphic-cards/graphics-cards/gtx-660m/gtx-660m/hard-drives/laptops/laptops/hard-drives/laptops/hard-drives/) on the computerbase website.

What you should do if you want to get a laptop with a graphics card that you don't want is to go to a laptop store.

If you want to make sure you get the graphics card you want, then go to a site and look for a laptop with that graphics card. You can then buy the laptop and check the parts list of the laptop on the website to see what you need to get in the laptop.

For example, I want to buy a laptop with a GTX 560m graphics card, so I go to a site like [this](http://www.macworld.com/article/207524/what-is-the-gtx-560m/) one, and then I buy the laptop.

The graphics card I want is actually a more expensive graphics card. It's about $300, but I can get it for $250. So at this point I have bought a laptop with a GTX 560m graphics card.",0

"I'm not an expert at all, but it seems to me like you're asking for advice on what to do instead of what to say. I'm not going to sit here and give you advice on what you should say. You should be asking these questions to help you formulate a plan of action that you want to try. You can't just ask for help on what you should do. That's not how this works. If you want to have sex with someone, you need to find a way to have sex with someone. That's a difficult thing to do, but you need to do it! This isn't a matter of if you want to do something, it's a matter of if you have the means to do it.

If you want to hook up with a girl, you need to ask yourself the question ""do I really need to do this?"" You need to make yourself feel like you want to, and you need to make her feel like she wants to. Make your intentions clear to her. If you just want sex, you need to make that clear. Be direct with her. ""If we're going to hook up, you're going to want to know that I'm on the pill.""

Also, there are hook-up apps that allow you to meet people, but only if that person has a verified email address or has an invite code. Or you can find people who are on a dating app that works for you. If you have friends you trust that you can go with, you can even start your own dating app. 

The best advice is to not be afraid of rejection because everyone has a bad time. If you want sex, ask! If you want to hook up with someone you know, just go.

I'm sure you've heard it before but the one thing that's helped me start hooking up with people and even get them to hook up with me is to talk about everything. I never wanted to hook up with a dude who was trying to guilt me into sex, but I've ended up hooking up with some dudes who were trying to guilt me into hooking up with them. 

Most importantly, don't be afraid to ask.

In any case it sounds like you have some work ahead of you if you want to get a hook up. Don't worry though. The good news is that if you are just in college and you have so much time to get to know people that it may be easier to just get to know a few people at a party or something?",0

Maybe we'll find out in TWOW.,0

"My headcanon is it's a result of the War of the Five Kings, it's basically the kingslayer that the people wanted to execute, but with the king's best interest in mind. He's the guy they can get more information from, and that means the king doesn't need to be involved in the actual trial.

At least one of these dimensions has to be the most important, and in the case of the material world, this dimension is probably the most critical. I don't know if the gate will open in any dimension where the gate is closed, but I'd bet that they will most likely make those dimensions accessible.

"The best way to get a girl to do anal is to make a deal with her. 

You can start by saying that you want it in your ass, and then she'll take it out of her pants and take you out to the bed. 

But if you're really serious, you can go into the bed and ask her to do anal with you, which is a much more intimate and personal thing to do with someone you deeply care about.

The best way to get a girl to do anal is to make her feel comfortable with it. 

When she's comfortable with anal, she'll start wanting it in her ass. When you're comfortable with it, it gets easier to use your hands to do it.

What a shocker: the only reason they are even trying is because of FCC regulations.,0
"The biggest problem with crypto is that there is no regulatory framework. The regulations are so convoluted and complex that many things they try to do will end up being pointless. The FCC's regulations are one reason why we are in this situation now and I'm glad that the FCC is out of the picture.

I'm sure most people are aware that these regulations are being implemented and that they are not going to go away anytime soon. The FCC's regulatory regime was created to stifle innovation and prevent the free market from functioning normally, but the regulations stifle competition, innovation and innovation is what blockchain and crypto are all about.

The regulations are also taking away all the advantages that bitcoin currently has over traditional services like the credit cards, cash and checks.

As long as these regulations stand - it will be very difficult for crypto to become even half as popular as it is now and even more difficult for it to grow.

I also want to know what is the benefit to bitcoin users using a credit card over a cashier's check or PayPal or a bitcoin wallet instead of a bitcoin wallet.

The biggest advantage to cash is also that it's reversible. We currently use all those credit cards to pay for everything with cash and it's a lot harder for us to just throw your card away.",0

"Can you say some more about your views on prostitution?

It is important to note that a large proportion of the sex working population are women.  However, prostitution is still a form of gender discrimination.  While men are the largest consumer of sex, women are the largest consumer of women.  In some places, women are able to work as prostitutes, but most countries do not allow this.  In most cases, women work as prostitutes by choice, and the main reason they do this is because of economic or social support.  This means that the women who prostitute themselves do so because they want to support their own lifestyle, and it is not because they need the money.  Women who prostitute themselves do so because to them and to their families that is the only way to survive.  It is simply not an economic necessity for most women to prostitute themselves.  It is simply about choice. 

Many prostitutes say they do it because of their own personal experiences, which makes me think that the main motivation for prostitution is the support of a woman's family, not her own personal desires.

So in your opinion, what does a woman in the sex industry do to make the experience for the clients as positive as possible?",0
"As a former sex worker, I want to say that yes, it is true, we as humans are naturally selfish creatures. We like to only focus on ourselves and don't give a shit about others. In that sense, sex workers are basically a kind of an extension of that. It is not that we are bad people, but it is how we were raised and the culture we grew up in. I have heard of numerous cases of human trafficking, of a woman being forced into prostitution, and of women being beaten and murdered. 

I do not know of any organizations that are specifically working against sex workers, only ones that are working towards the removal of harmful elements of the sex industry. It may sound like a paradox but the only way to fix the problem, is to remove the element that is causing the problem. For instance, we (sex workers) must support our families, take care of ourselves, be educated and get to know our customers. It is because of this that we are fighting for our rights. To further this cause, there are some organizations that have sprung up fighting for the rights of sex workers (which I do not support). Here is an example of one such organization.

http://www.sexworkers-project.org/

I know that you are an advocate for sex workers, and I do not necessarily agree with everything you've said, but I hope that you will take into consideration the opinions of sex workers (and those who are against the exploitation of sex workers) as you are working against an illegal industry.

I wish you the best of luck in your campaign.",0
"Hey Kara, 

I am a former sex worker. You might have met me before if you have any questions about the industry I would be happy to answer them.

I was a sex worker for a year and a half and ran my own sex work agency for a year and a half. The industry is very dangerous and people can be killed at any point. I am also one of the few sex workers living in the UK that has been able to open a new sex work agency with no problems. 

I work with the charity [Fluidic](http://www.fluidic.org.uk/). 

The industry is so dangerous, I started a petition to make it illegal to run sex work agencies in the UK. It has been signed by over 100 sex workers including many high profile names.

I have just come out with a new documentary on sex work and can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2PXw0mhfQ). Watch it in full and ask me any questions.

I also want to thank you for the excellent documentary which helped me get my start and I encourage anyone who is interested in supporting our mission to sign the petition. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the dangers sex workers face and it is vitally important that you support this campaign.",0

"It's not a matter of cost of living. It's a matter of the fact of the nature of the phrase. The fact of the nature of the phrase is that it is a statement of fact.

It's a statement of fact that the phrase has been in use for a long time. So a phrase is made in a way that expresses a fact as if it were a fact.

The phrase originates with a situation that was common in the late 19th century. It was a phrase that people said to express their dissatisfaction with the condition of the city. They said the phrase to express that they felt a state of discomfort in the city.

So, it comes from the phrase ""I'm too poor to buy a car"" or ""I'm too poor to buy a car"" as it sounds like a phrase that expresses a fact that is expressed in the phrase ""I'm too poor to buy a car.""

So, the phrase is a phrase that expresses a fact that is expressed in the phrase ""I'm too poor to buy a car.""

"I really, really love this guy.",0
"In this video I feel that Tillich is being extremely optimistic and optimistic in a way that is very close to the modern evangelical mentality.  It's almost like an idolatry.  I think that Tillich is essentially saying that if one is going to be a Christian, which for his time meant, ""If you're going to be a good man, if you're going to be a good person, you're going to believe the right things.  These are the things that you need to believe in order to be a good Christian.""  

I think, ultimately, Tillich is being optimistic in a way that is not realistic.  It's like a person who says, ""I want to win the lottery.  I'm going to win the lottery.  I'm going to win the lottery.  I'm going to win the ticket.""  

I think that Tillich is saying that the Christian life means that we are going to believe in God's goodness, and in the end, if you're going to be a good Christian, you're going to be a good person.  It's not that we would not believe in God if we were not good Christians.  It's that we believe in God because it's a matter of being a good Christian.  

I have heard people make the argument that it's not necessary to believe in God as a Christian.  In this sense, I agree with Tillich.  However, I think that Tillich would disagree with this as well.  I think that Tillich would say that, if you're going to be a good Christian, you need to be a good person.  Even if you're not necessarily going to believe in God, if you're good, you're going to be a good person.  

I think that Tillich's philosophy is not a form of idolatry, but it is one of a rejection of the idea that it's not *necessary* to believe in God.",0

I have no children so there's no future for me, and I know I'd be miserable without my wife and the kids.

The only reason I stayed when I left was to stay with my wife. But there's no way I could have done so if I was forced to go. I've always been the sort of person who values family, and it would be a complete waste of the opportunity I've spent my life working towards to give up on my family.

"Manufacturers offer a bunch of phones, and a guy with money can buy whatever he wants. 

The phones are all made on the same, relatively small scale - that's all the specifications that the company offers. The software is all the same.

The software is all the same, so the hardware that the company offers is the same.

It's really easy to sell hardware in a competitive market - you just need to make your product look the same.

With software, you need to make sure you don't have the same issues every time the phone is used. You need to make sure that the phone looks the same, and works the same, for every user.

This is tricky if you have an old version of the software that doesn't work on new software, because you might not be able to change it easily.",0
"In the case of phones, it's not so much the phone being bad. It's the *quality* of the phone. If the phone is the best on the market, they can charge a lot more and get a lot more market share.",0
"A manufacturer, like Apple, will make a phone that has only two main specs.

The first is the CPU. The second is the screen.

The manufacturer will then do a couple of things with each phone. First they'll decide whether it runs well enough on a specific version of Windows. If it's a Windows 8, 10 or whatever version they want, the phone will only run it well enough on that version of Windows.

They'll make sure it's fast enough on the CPU in the next couple of iterations.

Then they're making sure that this phone runs well enough on Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, Blackberry or whatever OS they decide to use for that specific phone. The more recent generation phones will have a lot more RAM and much higher end processors, so they'll also run better on Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, whatever OS they decided to use.

Finally, the phone manufacturers will make sure their phones are good enough at the CPU in the very least. If they have a phone that's running like shit on a particular version of Windows, they'll make sure the phone runs better on a different version of Windows, even if they don't have any particular reason to do that.",0
"They make the phone. They make the software and the software is the program the phone uses to send and receive texts.

You buy your phone and pay for the software. You buy the phone and pay for the software. So if a new phone comes out, you buy the software.

"When they come to a factory with a list of features they want to sell they have them go through a series of checks, the most important of which is what percentage of the population would buy the product. 

For example, if you want to sell a phone that has a large screen, it's probably going to be a high percentage of people that would want that feature, so you can probably sell a phone with a large screen for significantly more than you would for a phone with a small screen.

Another way manufacturers can determine what percentage of their customers would buy something is by what percentage of the customers in their target market also buy the same brand. If you have a lot of people in your market that share your brand, that would be a good sign that the feature is important to the people in that market.

For example, if you have a lot of people in your market that share your brand, but all of the people that share your brand also have a high percentage of people in their market that share your brand then that would be a good sign that the feature is important to the people in that market.

There could be other ways to do it, for example if you have a higher percentage of people that share your brand in a certain market then you have a higher percentage of the people in that market that want that feature as well. This would be a good sign that the feature is important to the people in that market. 

Some popular features will get a lot of users, so a manufacturer might price the phone at 100 dollars to get a high percentage of users that would be interested in that feature.",0

"There are different metrics that are used to judge this.

Manufacturers need to consider several factors when they decide what model is going to sell.

1. The models that sell are what they are going to sell 
2. Those models are going to sell will also sell
3. Those models that are going to sell will have a higher probability to sell 
4. The chances of the model selling is higher so the manufacturer will offer it.

These are all metrics that a manufacturer will use to decide if the model is good or not for sale.

One of the major factors is how accurate the device is in measuring the measurements that the manufacturer needs to know. 

If the product is inaccurate it will be difficult to sell the product and there will be a higher probability of that model not selling.

The other major factors are the quality of the product and the accuracy of the measuring of a product. 

If the product is poor quality and can't be accurately measured then the product will not sell and there is less chance of it selling.

Some manufacturers will also use qualitative criteria to determine which model is good or not for sale.

If a manufacturer decides that the model is good for sale then it will advertise it because there is a higher probability of it selling. 

If the product is good and the manufacturer decides that the model is not good for sale then they don't advertise the product and it will not sell.",0

It is the same principle in the case of a human being. In my opinion most of what is called, ""Zen Buddhism"" is just an attempt to describe what the Zen Masters teach. They were not interested in teaching Buddhism.",0

"I've been watching this series of lectures for a few months now. I have to say that I found these people to be very interesting, and the way in which they present material is excellent. This series is definitely worth to watch with at least an attempt to absorb some material while watching.

I'm not going to go deep into the lectures as much as I could. I wanted to share one thing more that I like about the course material. I really liked the way that they approached this type of teaching. They used a lot of analogies and analogies throughout the lectures. This type of teaching I find very interesting because it gives a lot of the same benefits as a textbook based class, but avoids a lot of the problems some students get with textbooks.

I also found the way in which the teacher made the lectures interesting. They were quite informal. I liked the way that the lectures were done. The teacher would often make very quick little jokes to the students. They were often funny. This was done because I found them very effective in getting the students to listen. But I found that this type of teaching is not very popular among the students. I think that this style of teaching is really important in this type of teaching, and it is a lot more effective than the typical lecture style.

I really like the series, and would like to hear more about it. I'm going to continue watching it if I can. I also like the way that I can listen to one of the lectures and have an in depth understanding of what the teacher is talking about at the same time.",0

"So a little background, I'm on mobile and sorry about any formatting issues. This all happened roughly around a year and a half ago. I live in a small town, and the population is about 2000. My best friend and I are both about 24 and have been friends since we were 13. We were raised in a Catholic community, so the majority of people just don't really talk to us. But some do, and we get along pretty well. I had to leave the country for a summer and go to college, and my friend had to take a semester off after getting her degree. We were hanging out on facebook, and my friend was talking to an acquaintance. I don't want to ruin the friendship, so I will call her friend ""Jane"" for the sake of anonymity. Jane started to talk to my friend about her boyfriend, and then she started to make jokes about me. So I called her out on it. She said that I am a terrible friend for calling her out on her bullshit, and she was being mean to her boyfriend. I told her that she was being rude to my friend, and that she's right. So I started yelling at her, and she just kept saying how mean I am. I told her that I didn't call her a bitch, and that she's wrong about her boyfriend. She keeps yelling at me until I've had enough. I start to call her a bitch, and she starts to call me a bitch. I've never been one to back down, so I end up yelling at her that this is a huge misunderstanding, and I apologize for yelling and insulting her. She stops calling me a slut, and then I start to call her a bitch. This continues on until she has enough. She tells me that I am being rude, and that I don't understand how this is a misunderstanding. Finally I told her that I am sorry if I was coming on too strong with the insults, and that I have always taken people's words seriously. She is so sad that I'm doing this, and I apologize for yelling at her and calling her names.  So that's that. I'm sorry if I didn't give enough info in this story, and I hope you guys enjoyed it!",0

"> For example, you have people in the gaming subreddit who are upset at the fact that there are too many games on Steam that are out of the ordinary and can't be enjoyed by a wide audience. As this is a huge part of their hobby, they want it to be as easy as possible for them to find the good games they want. This can be achieved by making it as easy as possible for them to find a game that they want to buy, and then making it easy for them to get it.

> Another way Valve can achieve this is to make it possible for Steam to easily detect if a game has been changed during the sale, and if it has been altered, it will automatically remove it from your library. This would mean that you will know as soon as a game has been changed that you should not buy it.

I think this is a lot better than a DRM.  As opposed to DRM, you can actually tell if a game has been changed if it's not being offered as a free demo (by either Valve or third parties), and if it is, it's too late.",0

I wonder what the reaction would have been had they been shot whilst on the run.,0
"William Tell (1812 - 1891) was a [brave Scottish officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tell) who took part in the famous Dreyer-Peru expedition of 1815. He was captured by the English while travelling to the Dreyer fortress at Chiricahua, Peru. He was killed there.

>He was captured by the British while travelling to the Dreyer fortress at Chiricahua, Peru. A number of soldiers and other mercenaries, including William Tell's son, Charles, were present. They all fled when they heard that the English had captured their leader. At the time, Charles was the only survivor of the expedition.

>He travelled to Chiricahua, then on to the village of Cuzco where he was captured. He was later killed at Chiricahua.

"I'm not too familiar with the history of those two brothers, but they seemed like a strange duo. The two of them seemed to be of a different breed. The brother who killed himself was supposedly quite a bit older than the one who didn't commit suicide, and I'm not sure how old the brother who committed suicide was.

I can't think of any other way to put it, but I think their relationship was strange.",0
How does that make me a rebel?,0
"I believe the story is more complex than that. 

There is the tale of William Tell, who was a very talented gunsmith. Once the brothers were inside the castle, they found a group of soldiers and attempted to kill them. They were unsuccessful and were subsequently shot. 

Another version of the story, possibly true, is that the brothers were attempting to leave the castle when they were ambushed by the soldiers. They killed the soldiers, but their leader was wounded and fled. They then killed the wounded soldiers and drove the vehicle into the castle. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the castle was very well defended. One source says that the castle was manned by several hundred men and that they had a large amount of rifles, which could quickly kill a person. They also had a very large number of arrows, which could very quickly kill someone. 

There is also the story of how one of the brothers, William Tell, was a very good fighter. He was the only one to survive the castle and that is why he was trusted with the role of the king. 

The story of the brothers is actually a few different stories. One version (which is probably the original, or at least one version of the story) is that the brothers were ambushed by the soldiers, and when they were unsuccessful in killing them, they shot them both and escaped. Another version, which I think is the most likely version, is that they attempted to leave the castle, but the soldiers caught up to them and shot them both. Another version, which I think is the most likely version, is that they were ambushed by soldiers and captured. Once captured, they were held in a dungeon until their death (which I think was in about a year or two).  

I'm not sure what the actual story is, but these stories are often confused together.",0
"As they approached the Castle of Breda, the brothers were met by several English soldiers. When it was time to go, the three of them took a carriage to a local inn, then rode around to the village of Breda. There, the brothers joined forces with a local citizen and a local village priest to attack the castle. The brothers then proceeded to drive the vehicle into the castle, and while they were inside, the citizens and the priest shot them both.

"I'm going to give you the advice that I think would be best for you: 

* Stop talking to your friend. This will scare off any girl who is interested in you. Instead, approach her. You should say that you're really looking forward to seeing her and ask her for her number. Then, hang out with her the weekend. If you see her again, ask for her number again. If you don't hear from her, then it's over. 

* Do you know where she lives? If you don't, go to the local police station and ask to speak to one of the cops there. They will be able to give you her information and possibly give you her address. Also, if you see her on the street, ask her if she wants to go out and have some drinks with you.",0

What is that white stone stuff around the throne? Is it a wall of some sort?,0
What a great explanation! Thanks,0
I've always wondered why the throne moved around so much.,0
"This is a nice summary, but there are some details I'd like to add.  The throne is surrounded by a wall of ice.  That's important, because it means the throne has to be *really* high up in the mountains (which is not easy to move around).",0
"It's not as heavy as iron, but it's still quite heavy. And as I said in my post above, since it's the only thing really close to the ground, the throne is also the easiest and most practical thing to move around on (and because it's so heavy, it's also easy to move around on).

Of course, the Iron Throne was also a very valuable thing, but it was also more difficult to move around on than a large stone structure (like the throne itself is) and the throne was also more difficult to move around on than a large stone structure (like the throne is).

So, all this is pretty much correct. But there's no need to get so upset over it.",0
"I'm so sorry but this is the kind of response I expect from an idiot. 

The throne sits on a hill, it gets up to a height of a few hundred yards, then its surrounded by a wall of white stone. It sits in the middle of a large mountain. What makes it easy to move around on is the fact that it is an easily recognizable landmark. This makes it easy to find the throne with a small map or compass.

The iron throne isn't as easy to move around on due to the fact that it sits in an inaccessible location to walk on. You can't just walk on it. 

If you want to know how big the iron throne is,  it is twice as heavy as the White Walker's army, and weighs about as much as the entire population of Westeros!",0
"It's also very light because the weight of the throne is concentrated on the middle area of the throne. That's why, as Dany notes, the throne is such a great place to hold a feast. That's also why the throne is so easy to move around on.",0
"I'm just curious, is the throne located in KL?",0
"It's a bit of a stretch to think that the Iron Throne is actually *that* heavy. It's probably just a big rock.

But as I understand it, it's not just ""easily moveable"" - it's *infinitely* moveable. I don't believe that anyone who came to Westeros could ever live in the south of the world without ever getting to the south of the world. The Iron Throne, though, can *literally* move around wherever it wants. I think this is because of the weight of the throne, not because of the sheer size and weight of the throne.

If you ever see the Great Sept of Baelor, you'll notice that it's basically a big rock in the middle of nowhere, with no stairs or ramps to get to it. The throne literally moves whenever it wants.",0
"I also believe that this makes the throne an excellent tool for the ruling of the Seven Kingdoms. The Iron Throne in the books is actually more powerful than the throne in the show. I don't think the Iron Throne in the books is just a plain old throne, but it seems to be an actual throne as well.

The throne is also where the throne room is.",0
The only thing the throne is good at is being a good place to sit.,0
I don't understand the need for a thick wall of stone when you could just use a solid stone throne.,0
It's also easy to move around on when you're standing on it.,0
">The throne is a large throne-like structure (probably made of stone in the books).

Not really. 

The throne is made of a type of stone that is extremely heavy, and is a giant, bulky piece of rock that a few people carry around. It's made of massive chunks. We don't know the weight of this throne, but this was an expensive throne. 

The throne doesn't make a lot of sense as a throne, because it's made of extremely heavy and bulky rock.

The real difference between a throne and a normal piece of rock is that the throne is placed *above* the ground, so it can be easily picked up and moved around. 

I think the real difference between a king and a commoner is the weight of the throne. The weight of a king makes him stronger, and thus more effective, but the weight of a commoner is more likely to put him down, or cause a fall to the ground. 

A king doesn't really have to worry about falling, but a commoner does.",0

I hope that AI researchers will get a lot of publicity and support for their research, because the more people involved in AI becomes better, the better.

I also agree that AI should be kept very secret until all the details are fully worked out, so that we don't have to worry about a few rogue AI's.

It's not so much a matter of which direction we are going in, but how do we make sure that it's done right.",0

"The best sex toy for me wasn't purchased by me - I used a dildo all through my sexual development (I didn't like to use vibrators because I felt like they weren't stimulating my clitoris). My first vibrator experience was with a rabbit vibrator - I loved that, but my boyfriend hated it because he felt it was too small (he's a bit of a size queen), but it certainly gave me something to start with.

The best sex toy I've ever used was the Hitachi Magic Wand - it was the very first wand I used, and it was the best one I've ever used. It's what I use now, and I absolutely love it. This may sound weird, but I think it's a really important feature - not just because of the size, but also because it has a lot of power, and it's very quiet. I've never heard a vibrator ""ring"" like this one, and it also has a lot of different settings (the more settings, the more powerful it gets, the longer it lasts). It's really powerful, and it's easy to control. My vibrator doesn't ring.

I also have a wand, and it's amazing. I just got one for my boyfriend because he hasn't used one before (I didn't like the Hitachi and I still don't like the Magic Wand), but I've never had one so powerful, and it's a really nice feeling in your whole body without the need of a partner. I've never heard it ring like it does with the Hitachi, and it has a lot of different settings. It's also quiet, and is rechargeable (it takes about 2.5 hours to charge).",0

"Wow, so Kubrick really has a way of talking about things that is unlike any other director. 

To me The Meaning of Life is a great movie, but it's really difficult to talk about Kubrick at length without talking about his other movies. So I'd like to hear what you think about these ideas you presented here:

*  In the last ten years there has been a number of films that have influenced the way we think about life and our place in it. There are films like 2001, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and The Shining that give a new meaning to life.

*  These films tell us that we are not the center of the universe. They also tell us that we are not special and only make up a small part of the universe and that we are not unique.

*  We are not more important than anyone else and we are not special.

*  We are not the center of the universe and we are not special.

*  The world, including all of its people, is full of suffering, but we are the only ones that have the ability to experience suffering.

These ideas are explored throughout his films.  They are presented in such a way that we are forced to confront the idea that we are not unique yet special.  At the same time, we are forced to confront the idea that we are all connected and that we are all part of the universe.

I think the last thing that really gets to the real issue in the movie is how the hero's wife is treated.  I've often seen this movie characterized as a ""cinematic rape scene"".  In my opinion, Kubrick was actually more concerned with presenting a story about how this man is coping with the loss of his wife than he was about the ""rape"" scene itself.  I think the way he's shown in the movie is a metaphor for the way people react when tragedy strikes.  He's not trying to be a hero but a symbol for a man dealing with loss.  This is why the final scene is such a turning point in the movie. It's a story about the relationship between a man and his child, and it has the same kind of meaning as the film.",0
"I've seen this film several times, and I think my thoughts on it are quite different from most people. The Shining is not a film about a man's relationship with life, it is a film about a man's relationship with his wife. Jack never had a normal romantic relationship with Wendy, he is obsessed with her not to mention he is a very abusive father, even to his children. Wendy is a victim of this, and Kubrick makes it quite clear that she is the sole reason for Jack's insanity. She is essentially the only one he cares about. 

Jack is a man of little choice, he is a man whose goals are not in any way based on his own personal desires, his goals are based on what he perceives as the wishes of his family. In my opinion this is an important aspect of the film. The other major theme is that of the father-daughter relationship, but Kubrick shows the father-daughter relationship as something that is very much a product of the father's own life. It is not simply the family that creates the relationship, but both parties are at the very least partially responsible in creating the relationship. Jack's relationship with Wendy is no more real to him than Wendy's relationship with Jack is real to her. The father-daughter relationship is something that is only possible between two people, and the father and son are in love with Wendy, or at least feel this way about her. 

Kubrick takes this to a much deeper place than most people do, to the point of it being almost impossible to understand. Most people when they think of Kubrick's filmography they think of the films that show the 'bad' aspects of his life (The Killing, for example) and they think of these as the main themes of his life. In my opinion, Kubrick is primarily a filmmaker, and the majority of his filmography shows a man trying to live up to his own expectations, which is something that is often depicted in most films. With this in mind I think it is important for you to think of the film as a film as much as you think of it as a relationship, and the film as such. 

I would argue that The Shining is a film about the relationship between a man and a woman. It is a film about a man's relationship with someone who is completely unlike him, and I think it is no coincidence that Wendy is a woman.",0

">On 15 August 1941, a day before Hitler was to invade Poland, General von Rundstedt was in Warsaw for the purpose of inspecting the forces. The first night of the city was practically abandoned, as soldiers were running around panicking. When Rundstedt, following the orders of General von Hoth, left the city that afternoon, he met no resistance.

>On 16 August, Rundstedt had left the city, and by the next evening, Hitler had crossed the river Narew and was able to see the city from the air.

>Rundstedt was the most important commander in the German forces in Poland, and he was the one who directed the actions of the entire German forces in the city.

>Rundstedt led the enemy forces to the city centre, and by the second day of the city, the general command of the army was in touch with Rundstedt.

>Rundstedt was a very good commander in the field and an accomplished soldier. One important reason for his success was due to the fact that he had a very great sense of honor and loyalty.

>As a result of the battle, the Germans captured from the enemy over 200 prisoners and an estimated 1,000-2,000 persons.

I think you're overthinking this. The main point is:

You're asking for something and you're getting it. The ""but you're not putting me on your plan"" is not an argument. It is a non sequitur. He's not trying to make it seem like he's keeping you from something you want, he's just trying to save his own ass.

How you feel about him doesn't matter. In your relationship you are his responsibility and he is not yours.

You are not obligated to be his friend.

It isn't his responsibility to pick out movies for you. 

If he wants you to go see his friends instead, he shouldn't have said he would pick the movie out.

If he did, you would have picked the movie out.

He is not a responsible adult.

Leave him.",0
"I'd say the first. This album is a lot of fun. It's the band going in a new direction and doing things they've never done before. The singer has more of a rock/pop voice and the songwriting is a lot more upbeat. I think this is the first album they've made that I can say is ""meh"" on.

The second is, as you say, good but doesn't really take the band anywhere. The singer has a little more of a pop/punk voice and more of a rock edge to it. The songs sound nothing like most of their past work. I mean, there's some good stuff, but it's not going to blow you away.",0

"I'm not sure what the consensus is on this, but I don't think it's just you. I think it's an example of something that's already been discussed in a few other posts, but The Room feels more like a critique of the 80s than a celebration of it. 

When I say that the ending is silly, I mean the ""Oh, I've got to try harder on a Friday"" feeling. I don't think it's a commentary on '80s nostalgia, but it's a commentary on how this generation tries to recreate the 80s. I'll admit that I don't really know enough about the early 70s to comment on that. 

I think the 80s are being celebrated in the film by the characters, but from an external perspective. Everyone is trying to recreate (and do better than) the lifestyle of the characters. The problem is, they're not even trying to make it look good. It's all fun and games, and the characters are just being themselves to mask their internal struggles.",0
"I love this movie! I just started watching it for the first time and I love it so much. I think the most important thing about the film is how much it's able to surprise and delight its audience. There are some obvious things that Tarantino has done in the past (ex. The Killing, Pulp Fiction, etc.), but I think his main thing here is how he takes the story, turns it into a film, and makes it feel fresh. I think with this theme in mind, I think it's easy to see why the ending is so much more than just the usual. This is a film that doesn't try to make the audience feel anything other than the same amount of shock and delight that it is intended to give us. 

The only thing I would say I think Tarantino does that I believe is a bit off is the ending; I think he tries to make us feel the story is over when it doesn't seem like it. But I also think it's a very effective ending. I don't think it would have worked as well if it weren't for the way Tarantino sets it up. Not only that, but it's a story that doesn't need to end. In a way, it's the same thing a lot of movies are doing - trying to give the audience closure. When it doesn't happen in this case, I think it comes off as kind of pointless.

Tarantino is a master of making things feel as though they exist outside of time, and I think that's why that ending works so well.",0
"I really want to know, too. I've been wanting to watch it again for a while, but I had a really bad experience watching it on a plane and had my eyes and my head all fucked up.",0
"I don't think the movie is really a parody of the 80s, I think it's more of a parody of the 80s, and of the way the 80s was marketed to kids. The 80s, and especially the early 80s, were a time of major turmoil for America. The Vietnam War was still going on, with the Cold War beginning to heat up, civil rights were being actively fought and overturned, and the economy was growing at an insane rate. In the 80s, it was a time of extreme consumerism, with everything on a shopping spree. So, when you have the ending of a film basically saying ""It's all gonna be okay guys,"" it's easy to see why it came across as a bit silly. But, I think you're missing the point of why this is a movie that's so much beloved. 

The ending is a parody of the overly optimistic and idealistic ending of a lot of 80s movies. In the 80s, they thought that the 80s was the new 80s. The 80s had amazing technology, such as the personal computer, and the personal computer was revolutionary, so everything was going to be okay guys, right guys, etc. The film is basically saying ""Yeah, but it was a lie, and it wasn't all going to be okay."" It's all about a lie, and how people feel about themselves after the truth comes out.

I'm not saying that was the point of the movie, or that it's perfect, and that's fine. But I think it's great that you feel that way. 

Also, if the movie is a parody of the 80s, it's a really great way to say ""It's all going to be okay.""",0
"I can't answer the film itself, as I have not seen it. But I'd like to respond to a few points in your post.

1) You're right to point out that the ""it's all gonna be okay"" scene was just really strange. It's like a parody of a scene we all remember from a movie.

It's a parody of 80s pop culture in the same way a lot of movies made for adults were a parody of the 70s, in that it's made with the intent of being entertaining, and in the same way many of those 80s movies were a parody of the 70s, as well.",0

"In a rural, predominantly Baptist (and sometimes Southern Baptist) community in the Ozarks, two young women disappeared from a restaurant in 1977. Only one of them was ever found; she was a suspect in the disappearance of her friend, but no charges ever got filed.  Two years after her disappearance, she had moved to Missouri to live with an aunt.  She had not been seen or heard from again. 

Three other people were murdered within a two-year period in this same area and, while the killer was never caught, he seemed to have had a relationship with the woman who lived there at the time. She also disappeared at the time. 

A similar case occurred in a small town in Mississippi, where a couple was murdered in a diner in November 1979. The victim, a woman, had disappeared a year earlier. The killer was never apprehended.

There was also a crime in Arkansas where both the killer and a victim were found to be in the presence of a deceased person, although they had not been killed at the time.",0
"One of the songs on the Beatles album ""Rubber Soul"" is ""Helter Skelter"" and it was inspired by a real-life event.  The song was written by George Martin after a night of drinking.  The lyrics of this song were written a few months before Martin was murdered in 1969 by Charles Manson.

"The Beatles were initially signed to Capitol Records in 1962. The year before, they met with George Martin, at which point Martin's manager, Tony Barrow - who had been in the band since the start - suggested they switch to an independent label. 

Martin, being a man of principle, agreed.

However, the Beatles' initial deal was with Capitol, which paid them a $20,000 advance (although later on they would get even more). When they refused to sign a release form for the record, Capitol threatened to sue them if they didn't. They left Capitol and signed with EMI, who paid them $5,000 to sign.

"This view is almost impossible to prove. You could argue that we are a representative democracy because of the election process, but that would be a pretty weak argument.

This view has some merit, but is not a sound basis for a view.",0
"The US is a constitutional republic.   The only way to have a true democracy is if there is a single uniting force, which is the United States itself and it's constituent elements.   But in practice this is not the case, because each country has its own interests and is in constant and often violent conflict.  

The only way to have a true democracy is for the people of each country to come together as one body, in a process called self-governance.   But this is not the case.   We live in a world of states that are not interested in self-governance, and that are not interested in the interests of their citizens.    

The US constitution is a constitution that was written to control the people.   It's an attempt to force the world into a kind of control.   

The only way to have true self-governance is for the people to control themselves.",0
"Democracy is basically the rule of the majority - the majority of the majority.

Representative democracy is the rule of the minority - the minority of the minority.

The US is a hybrid, with the two types of democracy in conflict with each other.",0
"> If the majority of the population wants a certain law, then that law is the law.

This isn't correct. The US has a system of checks and balances that ensures that government officials have a certain amount of power. As a result, officials can't simply overstep their bounds.

For example, let's say the US elected a president (say, Trump) who was against climate change. Now, Trump is a real estate billionaire and is very powerful. But he could not unilaterally pass a law making it illegal to emit carbon dioxide, because it would be unconstitutional. So, a bunch of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, had to form a coalition to pass a law making carbon dioxide emissions illegal.

Now, Trump could pass a law making it illegal to emit carbon dioxide, but he is likely to be impeached by the House of Representatives. He could then use this as further leverage to force the Democrats to vote for it.

And that would be unconstitutional.

This is the exact reason why majority rule is the way it is. The US is not a constitutional democracy, and so a system of checks and balances is in place to prevent the majority from overstepping their bounds.

Now, a country is not a state, and so the US has an absolute majority, and can pass whatever laws it wants. But a country is not a state, so it can't overstep its bounds. And so we have the system we have with the two systems of checks and balances.",0
"It's a hybrid, a mixture of direct democracy and representative democracy. The only way the US is truly a pure representative democracy is if you believe that a candidate can only be voted for on a one-person basis. The reason the people are given two ballots is because we live in a representative democracy. Voting is a way of expressing your opinions in the political process.",0
"You seem to be using the terms ""Representative Democracy"" and ""Representative Democracy"" interchangeably. In my opinion, the two terms are synonymous. 

If you are referring to a democracy, then the question is what form of government are we talking about here? A democracy has rules for how people are governed, and the rules that govern that government are made by the people in that democracy. A representative democracy is a type of government where the laws are made by people in a specific group. A representative democracy is the way a lot of people think of democracy; however, there are other types of democracies that do not follow this model. I think this is where the two terms come from. If you are referring to a political system, then the question is what kind of form of government is that system.

If all you are talking about is the US, then the democracy is the government. The government is made up of the elected officials, and the way they are governed is the way they are governed. A representative democracy is when the government is made up of elected officials and the way they are governed is the way they are governed. For example, in the EU, the EU is a representative democracy.

Basically the reason why we use the terms is because they are used interchangeably.",0
"I have to think about this for a bit.

I think your view is that the United States is a hybrid democracy, in which the majority has a say, but in which some can make a difference. I have to disagree. The US is a pure democracy. All of the government is decided by the majority of the country. No matter who you support, the majority will have control, so there is no way to disagree with the majority.

A pure democracy is where the majority is always right, as long as the majority can convince the minority of being right. A pure democracy is a dictatorship.

Also, I think you're using the term ""representative democracy"" incorrectly. I think that the US is a hybrid democracy, which is a bit of a technical term. A pure democracy is the only type of democracy that exists. A hybrid democracy is a type of democracy that exists.

To quote the Wikipedia page you posted, ""A hybrid democracy is a form of democracy in which the parties are controlled by the majority of the citizens, but the parties are not necessarily the same as those that represent the majority of the population as a whole."" You're using a technical term, which is not really a proper description of what a hybrid democracy is.

In addition, the majority of the people are not necessarily the majority of the people. A good example of this is the Electoral College. The majority of the people, those in big cities, have more power than the majority of the people, those in small towns, on the other hand. This is a good example of how there is no way to disagree with the majority and still be on the same team.

A hybrid could be a good idea. It's just not a good idea.",0

Maybe we could start a movement to create 3d printed robots and people could use them as a way to interact with the world. Maybe we could see a decline in food prices, etc.

I think that the rise of super intelligent AI and automation technology could lead to a society that is more open to other people living differently than we do. Or maybe we could see a societal collapse where machines don't make us happy, and are forced to kill us all? Maybe we could end up having machines that are smarter than us and they kill us.

* You're still young and have lots of time to get to know her. 
* It's possible that you're not in love. A lot of people can fall in love without necessarily making a commitment to that person.

"I don't think so. I think we see this as a very early version of Starfleet. From the first contact they were already on a path to become the Federation, with all of their exploration and scientific pursuits.

On the other hand, the NX-01 may have been a ""First Contact"" with an alien species that was already in the Delta Quadrant, and was already the Federation. It may have been sent there as a diplomatic mission. The Vulcans may have already had a Starfleet presence in the Delta Quadrant. The Federation probably had a few ships in the Delta Quadrant already. So I'm kind of leaning towards it being a Federation mission, but not the first contact. But it's not until the 23rd century that Starfleet is established, and Starfleet's first mission is to study and explore the galaxy. It's not until the 24th century that they become the Federation.

Also, remember that when Kirk and company returned, they had also been there for a month. From that point on, Kirk and company started to see Starfleet as a permanent presence. And I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that the Enterprise-D was used for science and exploration for the next few decades.",0

I've always thought that the Enterprise was the ""first contact"" in the sense that it was the first Starfleet ship to ever leave the Alpha Quadrant, and in doing so set off a chain of events that led to the formation of the Federation, and the First Contact with the Klingons.

The Enterprise was the first ship to leave the Alpha Quadrant and come into contact with the Klingon Empire, and the first Federation vessel to be attacked in that same quadrant.

As a result, it would likely be more expensive to build, and a lot of resources would have to be dedicated to its construction.",0

The standard model and quantum field theory is based on black holes. That said there is more to black holes than the standard model. There are other theories and models that have been proposed and tested, however none of them could ever be proven completely correct.",0
"We don't know a whole lot about the behavior of a black hole because it is very difficult to observe. If we did, we would be able to observe certain predictions we would make, but we don't know if this is even possible, or what the conditions would need to be to make this happen.

The magnetic field is one example of a prediction (or prediction from the outside) of the black hole. I suspect there are other situations where it would be possible to observe the magnetic field of a black hole if we were able to look in a certain direction.",0
"A good way to think about this is to imagine a 3D world. Here's the first 2D surface:

The first 2D surface is made up of a 1D surface made up of an infinite number of 1D surfaces, and then a 3D surface made up of an infinite number of 2D surfaces.

Now, let's say there was a black hole somewhere in the first 2D world.

When light is emitted, it is absorbed by a 1D surface. The 1D surface then passes through the 3D surface, which then passes through the 1D surface, etc.

Now, we're starting to get into 3D. The 1D surface is actually not a full 3D surface. Now, we have a 2D surface that is also not a full 2D surface. The 3D surface is an infinite number of 2D surfaces that are all overlapping, and each surface is made up of an infinite number of 1D surfaces.

Now, we're starting to get into 4D, and the surface is an infinite number of 1D surfaces. As we get into the 3rd dimension, the number of infinite dimensions approaches a number that is a multiple of the number of dimensions. 

We eventually reach the 3rd dimension, which is actually a super number of infinite dimensions, and the surface is an Infinite number of 1D surfaces.",0
"This is a really interesting question.

At this point the only thing we really know is that it's not possible to actually see a black hole!  The most we can say is that there have been predictions based on theoretical predictions.  They haven't always been accurate, but some have been confirmed through observations.",0
The magnetic field around a black hole is produced by the gravitational field of the central black hole. So we can't really say much about its behavior.,0
"As far as we know, it does not.

>For example, does our understanding of the dynamics of a black hole include an understanding of the ""magnetic field""?

It does not depend on the density. For a black hole denser than a neutron star, the magnetic field is not relevant.",0
"No, we don't know the behavior of a black hole. We do know how the black hole is observed by the universe, however. These things are called ""instruments"" of the universe. If a black hole has a mass of M=M_black, we know (because the universe ""appears"" to be rotating around it, as it is a black hole) that after a time there should be a star in the way of the black hole.

And, yes, the magnetic field is present. It's just not strong enough to keep the star in place.

This is why we don't have a good idea of the behavior of black holes. It's not that we don't know what they do, it's that we don't know *how they act.*

Black holes are just a very peculiar object that we haven't really found the right ways to study yet.",0

> What is the legal status of a car in transit? Does the car have to be delivered to the buyer and then returned to the buyer?

As a general rule, a car can't be in transit for more than 14 business days.

So, let's put it this way. Let's say that you have a car in transit and it is not in your possession anymore. You are not in possession of it anymore. (This is a simplified version of what's going on. I've added some qualifiers like ""in my possession"" and ""not in my possession"" to clarify what is what. I'm not trying to be a legal expert. I'm just trying to help you understand.)

As a general rule, the buyer of a car is responsible for the return of the car. This is because the buyer is responsible for paying for the actual cost of the car, not just a portion of it's cost.

>Is it still legal for me to have my car and pay for its return if I am not in possession of it anymore?

Yes, it is.",0
"A car is usually in transit when it is being serviced.  It may still be in transit if you called the manufacturer, or you have it listed for sale in your local dealer's online inventory.",0
"I am not a car expert, but I believe you are correct in your understanding of what it means to have your car in transit. 

>How long can a car be in transit? For example, I can have this car in transit for 8 business days but because of this I would be liable for paying for its return?

A car may be in transit for longer than 8 business days, but is liable for its return if you fail to return it within a certain time period (generally, 6 days). 

>What is the legal status of a car in transit? Does the car have to be delivered to the buyer and then returned to the buyer?

It is not unheard of for car purchases to take longer than 9 business days to arrive, but there is a window of time that the car is considered in transit for. 

>Is it still legal for me to have my car and pay for its return if I am not in possession of it anymore?

I don't know.",0
"If it's not in your possession anymore, then you bought it with it.  And it is your insurance company's responsibility to pay for the vehicle.  In the unlikely event that it gets stolen, it needs to be reported to the police.",0
"Your insurance company will have to notify your insurance carrier of the car being in transit. There is a fairly simple process that insurance companies have to follow when they want to notify a policy holder.

This process requires you to provide your insurance card, the vehicle, and the make and model of the car. The insurance company then asks for a driver's license and proof of insurance. This is often a photocopy of your license, but sometimes it is not. 

Insurance companies generally don't want to notify people of vehicle in transit. They want to notify the policy holder of a vehicle being in transit.

In your case, you are not the policy holder. Your insurance company has no legal duty to notify you.

If you are the policy holder, you may contact your insurance company and request a new insurance card. The insurance company may decline to do this, but may give you another card that has the same information and may ask you to come in to the office and present it.

If your vehicle is still on the lot, you are still liable for paying for its return.",0
Your vehicle is still in transit. The fact that you bought it means the car is still in transit. You also bought the car knowing the risk you took by purchasing it... You should not have bought it. Your return policy is a liability for the company and you should contact them to get a new return policy.,0
">*Is it still legal for me to have my car and pay for its return if I am not in possession of it anymore?

Yes.  It's also legal for you to be liable for the car.",0
"The legal status of a car in transit depends on the state and, in Minnesota, the transaction date. You can find the laws on the Minnesota state website.  

If you bought the vehicle from a private party - that is, the seller cannot legally give you possession of the car before you purchase it - then the car is considered ""in transit"" until you receive it. If the car is delivered to you, then it is not considered ""in transit"" and you have no obligation to pay for its return.

That said, there are other laws in Minnesota that may apply to your situation. Please review the [Minnesota General Statutes](http://legis.state.mn.us/Statutes/GS/GS.pdf) to see if there are any additional laws that might apply.",0

"> Capitalism is essentially built on the backs of workers and consumers.

Not true. Capitalism is a voluntary social contract between private corporations. It requires both of these to function, and not just one or the other.",0
"In my understanding, capitalism is essentially the best system that we currently know of and a lot of that is due to its benefits to consumers.

The problem comes in when the cost of living increases too much, so that the people who are making the profits can afford to pay those costs, but the people that are paying them can't.

That's what happens when the workers become the employees.",0
">To make a product (as you all understand things), you just need to buy it from a manufacturer (or, in the case of an organization like the State, a bank).

I think this is misleading. A market is a system where two parties (producer and consumer) agree to exchange something. In a capitalist society, the producer can sell the consumer the product. This exchange is voluntary because the producer has a choice between two people willing to buy the product.

>To run the factory or to sell the product, consumers must buy it from the manufacturer, so the manufacturers are able to earn a profit. This leads to a system where most of the wealth is generated from the workers, and that's really only possible by taking away the power of the workers.

This is a pretty big strawman. This is not the same as taking away the power of the workers, because it involves taking away the power of the producers.

>And the way to get that to work is to remove the power of the workers and the consumers.

The power exists in the individual, not the system. The system is made up of individuals, but the power of the individual is greater than that of the system. The power of the individual is the source of all progress.

>You can't make it better than how it is in Capitalism, because if you try you'd just be taking away from the power of the workers.

">To make a product (as you all understand things), you just need to buy it from a manufacturer 

I think this is where you're wrong. You're conflating the manufacturing process with the consumer end.

>To run the factory or to sell the product, consumers must buy it from the manufacturer, so the manufacturers are able to earn a profit. This leads to a system where most of the wealth is generated from the workers, and that's really only possible by taking away the power of the workers.

It is by removing the power of the workers to the point where they are the only ones who can profit.

I do think, however, that an artificial intelligence would be a very bad thing.

First of all, what purpose does self-awareness serve? I think that it would be a detriment to society. How can you have a society if you don't understand what it means to be a human?

A human that is self-aware, would have a much larger ego than one that is not. As such, most humans would lose their ability to relate to one another, or to have compassion for others. An AI would be much different.

I would even go further and say that a computer that is self-aware, would become a terrible thing for society. It would be much more selfish, and much, much more dangerous.

I am not saying that you shouldn't feel overwhelmed right now. It's okay to feel overwhelmed.

I think you are going to have to make some decisions about your future. You have a lot of work to do, and you have a lot of things to do as well. You have to decide your next move.

Do you have someone who you can talk to?

If so then maybe the answer isn't to find some sort of internet forum, but rather it's to find someone who you can talk to and share what you are going through with.

This has allowed me to open up to more people, and to more people become comfortable and willing to listen. 

One of the most important things you can do to help someone is to talk about the things you are experiencing. 

I'd recommend a forum like this if you feel someone is suffering:

https://www.buddhismtoday.com/

It's a community for spiritual seekers that is run by Buddhist monks. 

There are some spiritual seekers on this forum that are more than willing to help. 

If you really want to talk to someone, then I'd recommend trying your luck at some of their live events. 

Even if you are going through a hard time, it's worth it to talk to someone you can relate to. 

For this specific event, a particular community member offered to help me out. I was in an abusive relationship for nearly a year and she was the only one who was around for me. She was my ""spiritual guide"" during that time. 

It was a difficult thing to go through, and I was scared to talk to her about it. After a few weeks of talking, I was able to get her to help me with some of the things I was going through. 

I think it's worth the effort to talk to someone who is willing to help you. 

I believe you can find a community of individuals who will help you if you truly want to help them.",0

I also just need to vent to someone. Someone to talk to. I need someone to talk to.",0
I'm very thankful for this community and what it has done for me. I feel like I've been able to see this world more clearly than when I was just a random internet troll.,0

"I use Spotify for discovery. I find the music I want by looking at artist pages on the main album page.

Sometimes I'll add the songs to my wishlist, but mostly I just leave them in the playlists they are in.

I also use Pandora for discovery. I search for albums on Spotify from the album page and then use the ""All"" box to filter by genre. I'll also sometimes add the songs to my playlists, but most of the time I just leave them in the playlists they're in.",0
"I don't really know how many of you out there are in Canada, but if you have a Pandora account you can get the music radio app to play whatever songs you choose at a whim.

I generally browse for stuff that I like on Spotify or Pandora, and if I like it, I'll usually buy it. For me, sometimes I'll only buy it if I know the artist's name, like ""The Weeknd"" or ""Tame Impala"". I also like to buy stuff on Bandcamp, and I usually don't buy it unless I know the artist's name. I'll usually listen to the album's track listing on Spotify or Pandora, and then go to the album's [bandcamp](https://www.barcamp.com/album/name) page. Sometimes you have to login to buy the album, sometimes you can just click the ""+"" button. Sometimes you can't buy or listen to the album just through Bandcamp.",0

If you are into live music, I try to find live music on Spotify and Pandora. I have a Spotify account, but I usually don't use it since my music has been found by Rhapsody, Pandora, and Shazam. It's a bit hard to search for more live music, though, when new music happens all the time.

I also listen to new music on Spotify while I'm on the train. When I get a new song on Spotify, I check out the artist on Wikipedia (if I can), but I also look up the track on YouTube and check out the video on Soundcloud. I usually enjoy watching videos that feature new music.",0
"One tip I like is to just not listen to music for a few weeks. Even if you're in the car, at work, or whatever. I'll go on the internet for a week and just randomly stumble across music that I haven't heard before. Then I'll go back on the internet for the next few days, and pick up where I left off. Repeat like 5 or 10 times. I tend to use Spotify's shuffle feature, but my listening habits might be different from yours. I also use Pandora for music recommendations, but for my tastes, it's more of a playlist. I don't really use the radio anymore.

Another tip I have is to try and find artists and songs that you know very little about. Just a few albums, maybe a couple songs. If you really like them, then you can follow them on Spotify or find new songs by checking their profile on YouTube.

I'm probably not the best person to ask this question, but I'd love to hear from someone who works in streaming.

">The American Dream is literally about having a nice house and a car.

I don't think that's true.

Most Americans have no desire to own a house, and most people would rather rent. According to a survey done by the University of Virginia:
>""Among the major findings:

>Nearly two-thirds (64%) of adults in the U.S. believe that it is better to rent than to own a home;

>Less than half of adults (43%) believe it is better to own a home than to rent.

>Renters are more likely to be female (61%) and less religious (74%) than owner-occupiers (71%). Renters are also less likely to be employed full time (16%) or part time (27%) and to have a high school education (20%) or college education (12%). And they are less likely to have a mortgage (27%) than homeowners (44%).""

"I don't think it's really about the white picket fence, or having a stable family. It's about having a good life and a good life is a combination of a good job and a good car and a good house and a good job. 

It's about having a stable life.",0
"""The American Dream"" is very much a metaphor. I've always seen it as a dream (a dream about something that has already happened). 

The American Dream is like a dream where you have a lot of things. Like you have a house, a car, and a dog. But those things weren't even really yours in the first place. You didn't earn them, the government gave them to you. The only thing that makes you an American is that the government gave you those things. All you have is the belief that you are an American. The point of the American Dream is to have something you believe is yours.

So this belief, that you are an American, is the only thing that truly matters.

If I could somehow create a new government program that gave EVERYONE, no matter how poor, free housing, free cars, free education and free healthcare, and then tell everyone that they were part of the American Dream, I'd probably be elected president.",0
"Do you ever consider that things are not what you want them to be?  That the reason you have a dream is because it's the best you have?  If you're struggling for money, the American Dream for a middle class family in most of the country isn't a stable family, a stable job, and a white picket fence.  And if you do have it all, you're probably not living a life where you can do things like go on vacation and get a dog.",0
"I can see where you're coming from, but I think the best answer to your question is that the American Dream is about having a house, a car, and a dog.",0
"I think the first part of your post is pretty accurate. And I think it would be true for any country.

""The American Dream is the only thing that matters.""

I mean, that's pretty much true for every country and every person that lives there. But then you have the second part:

""The American Dream is the only thing that matters.""

I think that's a little off, because it's pretty much true for every country and every person that lives there.

So, I guess the point is ""It's the American Dream"" is a little bit of a lie because it's true for every country and every person that lives there and they're pretty much all going to be in the same boat if they're living in a country or in a country's society.

I don't think there's a need to lie to make people have hope.",0
"I would like to give a counter argument. I feel like the American Dream is a myth, but I don't know enough about history to know if it was even a good idea to be an immigrant. 

First of all, we had a lot of immigrants in the past. We were a nation built by immigrants. However, the past 40 years has seen an influx of immigration. There are very few immigrants in the US right now, with fewer still being naturalized citizens. The numbers are so low that they're a fraction of the immigration numbers in the 1960s. 

I would argue that there's more to the American Dream than a simple house and a car. There's the whole idea of a stable family. People come here to provide their children with the best life that they or their parents could have or that they could have in the US. So you see these people who come here to bring their families and their families' kids with them. They want to be the best they can be. And that's how it always should be.

But how do we as a country define a stable family? One idea is to look at things like education, income, healthcare, crime, and so on. These are all things that can be measured. I think it's also important to consider that these are all measured against each other. What we measure does not guarantee what we want. It's important that we have some measure of what we want.

I think this leads to an important question for the future. What do we want? What do we want the future to be like? I think it's important to ask ourselves what we want today and to have a conversation about what we want the future to be like.

I also think it's important to consider that the US is a very large country. There are many people who don't have the opportunity to be American. There are also many people who don't have the opportunity to be American. But, there are also many people who don't have the opportunity to be American, and there are many people who have the opportunity to be American. So I think the American Dream is important, but it is not the only thing that matters.",0

"Kirk in TNG was definitely a villain--the villain of the series, that is. He was an arrogant fool who thought he had the right answers, and he had the wrong answers. He was a hypocrite who lied for the right reasons. He was arrogant, petty, and had no self-awareness. He was ruthless. He was a dick.

But at the same time, there was still hope for the Federation in him, the hope that he might one day learn to be a good person. If he was a hero, he would have destroyed the Federation by then. If he was a villain, he would have destroyed the Federation by then. The Federation was in crisis, and Kirk was at the helm. And he was *fighting* it. He put Starfleet on a pedestal, and Starfleet was the way forward. He was saving the day.

And finally, at the end, you have the Romulan commander--a villainous, selfish, evil man--telling him to go home. There's no way he could have saved the Federation and he couldn't have even saved the crew of the Enterprise. He was a villain and a hero, and his decisions were all the more heroic because he was a hero.",0
"I think the problem is that Spock is not Kirk.  He is a Vulcan, and Spock is a very serious and mature man.  Kirk is not.  He's a kid, a scientist, and a hero.  Spock's purpose on Earth was to be a scientist, which he is, and it's a noble one.  Kirk is still a man, and Spock still has to be the cool and mysterious, but not the emotional guy.  It's hard for Klingons to not be mad at Spock, but they are still heroes (in a way).

Kirk is the only hero they've got.  He's the one they want to be.  They wanted a hero, and they got one, and it's a good one.",0
"I think the problem is that the character that Kirk was at the point of ""Redemption"" was not a hero. He had destroyed the planet that was a part of his home planet, and he was not willing to do a damn thing to ensure that the Romulans' home world was saved. All he did was leave a message, and then he left. It was not a heroic act, and it was one that he clearly wanted to avoid at the end.

So if he was just an anti-hero like the character we see on-screen, his heroic actions wouldn't have been heroic either. He was a villain.",0
"I would argue that Kirk's actions are heroic, and in fact, often the only way to save the Federation from certain doom. There is no denying that his actions are based on what he really wants to do, but he has been repeatedly shown to have done just about everything that he could possibly want to do, even when it wasn't necessary. 

In particular, I would argue that the Romulans are the only enemy they have that is a threat to the Federation as a whole, and they are only one step away from outright war with the Klingons. Kirk is willing to do whatever it takes to save Spock, even if it means risking the Federation on the way.",0
"What you're saying fits with my interpretation of the movie more than anything. 

Kirk is the hero on his own terms, but he's a really good character. 

He doesn't want to save humanity, he doesn't want to save the Federation, and he doesn't want to be the hero. He wants to save Spock, but he also wants to save the planet.

But the Federation is in a terrible state. We see this through the Klingon Civil War, the destruction of their ships and colonies, and the Romulan incursion. They're going through a lot of turmoil and they need the Federation to help them.

I don't think Kirk wants to be the hero. I think he wants to be *a* hero.

But, this leads to the issue of why they don't just have Kirk as the bad guy. I think the movie doesn't have Kirk as a bad guy because it would require them to change their theme. A ""hero"" is a good thing, it's about saving someone or something. So, they don't have Kirk as a bad guy. He's a good guy. He's doing the right thing.

But, he's doing the right thing because he's *the hero* and saving Spock is the right thing to do.

The movie wants us to think that Kirk is a bad guy, because we're watching a conflict between the Federation and the Klingons, and we're not just watching a conflict between humans and Klingons.",0
"I've always thought that the problem with Kirk was that he was a hero in a sense, but the hero that he was was not the one you would expect to be a hero. His most famous moment is when he kills the Talosians, and I can understand why that would be memorable to someone like Kirk, but I can't imagine that a Starfleet officer would make that decision.

I think that maybe that's why he is such an amazing father. It's hard to imagine that a Starfleet officer would be a father that way. But Kirk has a history with his son in the form of being a father, and it makes him a good father when he is with him. I think the reason he's a hero in a sense is that his son is essentially a hero in his own right.",0
"The Romulans weren't the Federation's enemies, they were *their* enemies. They had no reason to help the Federation, and had no reason to attack them.

The Romulans were the ones who destroyed Vulcan, and took Vulcan's secrets. They had no reason to help the Federation, and had no reason to attack them.

The Romulans were the ones who were in the wrong, and Kirk and Spock did the right thing. And the Romulans would be the ones who would be the villains in the next film.",0
I think a lot of the times it was like Kirk was using his position to do good things and doing good things was what was good. Sometimes he would do things that were against his own ethics or against the Federation's but he did it simply because he didn't trust the Klingons. For example when Kirk and Spock were on the Enterprise to rescue McCoy and Scotty they didn't even know the Klingons were on the attack and Kirk didn't trust them. He needed Spock to save them and save McCoy but he didn't want Spock to trust the Klingons and so he saved them at the risk to himself.,0
"I agree that TOS is in many ways a darker and more violent version of TNG. This is due in no small part to the shift in production from the mid-60s to the mid-70s. This meant a shift in emphasis from portraying humans as the heroes of the Federation to portraying them as the villains of the Federation.

At the time, the Federation was a beacon of hope that humanity could eventually be redeemed. But, by the time TOS arrived, the Federation had been reduced to a collection of petty feuding factions and the only remaining hope for the Federation was to unite them under a single leader: the Romulans.

In fact, the Romulans are the only major race that does not ally itself with the Federation.

Kirk is the ultimate embodiment of the dark side of the Federation. A man who only sees things in black and white. If he's a hero, it's bad. If he's a villain, it's also bad.

His desire to destroy the Federation is the only true hero in the franchise. And the only one who is also a villain.",0
"I actually don't *like* this answer; they would have to re-do everything about the whole situation to fit this idea. Not only Kirk was obviously a villain, but he was also a traitor who was more than willing to lie to the Federation about the Romulans.",0
"I think in general, Kirk was portrayed as a villain in the TOS movies. Most of his actions were to save Earth, which is a noble goal. But he also took a lot of action that was morally questionable. The Kirk we know was a hero in the sense that he was the one who *wasn't* willing to sacrifice. But the Kirk who took up the mantle of the Federation, he was willing to die for his people.

But the Romulan war was a war that couldn't be won, and it was a war that was fought on the basis of the principles of the Federation - diplomacy was the key. So Kirk was a hero in that sense.",0
"I think that the Kirk we see in TOS is more of a traditional hero. When Kirk is on the Enterprise, he's a hero. He's a leader and a patriot. When he's off the Enterprise, he's basically a madman.

When Kirk gets back, he's an arrogant ass.",0

She may be in the process of getting pregnant.

I am now thinking about dropping her as I am starting to feel her period.",0
"I would go to the pharmacy and get one for her. It's much more convenient to get the damn thing in a day than all of a sudden and it's really hard for her to find a bathroom because she's so big. 

Also, I would tell her that you're so excited for her but I'm very concerned for her health and her future. She's not ready for kids and I'm very worried it might cause issues down the road.",0
"> I know it's not healthy, and I don't want her to get pregnant. What do I do?

Not necessarily. She could have gotten a pap smear and the results could be all good. She could be on the pill, just not on it when she gets her period and they would show up. She could have just had sex. She could have had a very light period, one that wouldn't show up unless she were to go to the bathroom right after. 

I'm not sure what's going on, but I think you need to just let her have her period, and wait it out.",0
"I'm sorry she's not having her period. I hope she finds one and gives you some. It's great that you've been able to support her.

I'm not sure if you said anything about pregnancy, but maybe you could talk to her about it. Her reaction to pregnancy sounds like she didn't think it would happen to her. She's probably not having her period yet, and if she gets pregnant, it'll be a lot harder to get rid of the baby. If you want to be with her for your whole life, I think you should talk to her about it.

Also, if you do want to date her, talk to her about birth control. Birth control is great.",0
"She's not having her period because she's old, and she's too old to be having her period.  She's having her period because she's having sex.  She's probably using a tampon, but she's probably just a little embarrassed that it's just sitting in a drawer somewhere.  She is old enough to be having sex!  I think she's fine though.  Just don't start dating before you have her period.",0
"As a man, I can say that it is not easy to go down on a woman that just had her period without a tampon.

If she really wants to go down on you, she should go down on you while you take her out to the bathroom. She doesn't want you to go down on her when she's bleeding. She is likely just too embarrassed to do it.

However, if she is trying to avoid pregnancy or she just doesn't want you to go down on her, she might just tell you it's because she can't find a tampon. But I wouldn't worry about it as it's going to happen to so many girls.

That being said, do not start dating her until she is clean. She doesn't want to get pregnant. Periods are normal and a normal part of life that women need to deal with. But she should be getting her periods every month.",0
">I've asked her, but she's been really rude and just said it's because she can't find a tampon, that it's just hard. She says she'll find one, but she'll probably just take my word for it, because I'm the man.

This is so frustrating to read.  You are the man on this one.  If she's unable to find a tampon, she should not be dating you.  She's not in a very good place mentally and emotionally.  She needs a break and some time to sort things out.",0
"One thing you might find interesting is that the first humans to become settled in the Americas did not go into the forest alone. A fairly large number of hunter-gatherer groups settled in the area between present-day Chile and Peru, and there is some evidence of agriculture in the area. We know that early human settlement in the Americas was very slow and took a long time to be developed.

The first human settlers in the Americas had to adapt to a new environment. They had to develop new food sources. They had to build their own shelters, and develop new ways of hunting and gathering. They had to develop new ways of farming. Eventually they developed their own language and culture, and then they began to settle and develop new cities. They developed a new civilization. They started to develop agriculture and started to cultivate crops. They had to deal with different environmental conditions than they did in their previous habitat. The first humans in the Americas were quite an interesting lot, and although they were able to survive on their own, they did not have it all figured out. They had to adapt to the new environment, they had to adapt to the new food sources they encountered, and they had to adapt to the new language they had to learn.

The first human settlers that arrived in the United States were a group of hunter-gatherers. They were moving into a new environment, one that they had never encountered before. They had to adapt to a new lifestyle, they had to adapt to a new language, and they had to adapt to the new climate they were moving into. They had to adapt to all of this, and it took them a long time to be adapted. They had to adapt to new food sources, they had to adapt to new ways of living, and they were all adapting to the new way of dealing with the environment.

In time, they became settled enough to start a new way of life, one that suited them.

But the first human settlers in the Americas did not have the same advantages of a group of hunter-gatherers.",0
"The simple answer is: they were just *that* lucky.  There are plenty of species that would be nearly extinct, yet we live.  There are plenty of species that would be nearly extinct and yet all living species have survived.  You can't just go hunting and then expect to hunt all the surviving animals.  A few were lucky, and then the rest of the animals became accustomed to humans and therefore were able to hunt and eat you.",0
"Yes. A lot of modern humans left Africa and walked from Australia to South America, the last stop being the Americas.

"I think a socialist party is the way to go.

The US is a capitalist country with a capitalist party. Socialism is a system focused on the working class. Socialism is the only way to truly fight for social equality.",0
"I'd argue that the US isn't really socialist yet, but I'd like to see it improve. So that's why I'm a Social Democrat in the US.

I think that in the USA, a large portion of the population already rejects socialism. But with that said, we need to use the current political climate to push the American people in the direction of socialism. We need a lot of people to get behind the idea that socialism is the best type of government. That the US is a capitalist country, and can improve upon it with the reforms we have today.

Right now, we need to work to change the US electoral system. Right now, we need to be able to get enough people to vote for candidates that we believe will promote the goals that we believe are necessary for the US to improve.

But there's no way to do this without having socialism in the US. Socialism will help improve the lives of the American people, but it will also benefit capitalists more than socialists.",0
"The way I see it, socialism/communism is what's best for the US, and we need to keep our eyes on that goal. That doesn't mean we have to take the easy route to get there, but it also doesn't mean we don't have to keep trying. I'm in.",0
"There's a reason why the US is the only country where you can have a full blown socialist revolution. People have been fighting for the workers since the beginning, and I think we need to push harder to keep this momentum going. There are millions of people in the US who want and need basic workers rights to improve the life of working people but most of our elected representatives are owned by the rich and don't represent us. What we need is a mass movement to get politicians who represent those working people elected.",0
"Well, I think it's important to keep in mind that there are a lot of people on this sub that have a lot of privilege, and this is a great way of showing them that socialism can work to benefit them.",0
">The US is a capitalist country, and there are many reasons to get behind the political system.



No. There are no good reasons to get behind the political system. This is the fundamental problem with most leftists who defend this system. They fail to realise that a political system can never be morally defensible.",0
I wish you the best of luck in figuring out what to do.,0
"Hey man. I'm not sure how old you are but I would say maybe you're old enough to make your own decisions.

A relationship can be a lot of pain and suffering, and it can go through so much in such a short space of time. It's hard to keep one person in your life when no one seems to want to be there for you. It's hard to keep one person in your life when you just want to break up with them and move on. It's hard to keep one person in your life when you don't know if you're going to get that love you're looking for. Sometimes life just seems to drag you down, and you don't know what to do. You're not young anymore and you've got a lot of experience under your belt, so it's OK to give it up to do what you need to do.

I'm not sure what your girlfriend's family is like, but maybe it would be wise to just take a break from them and go spend some time with your friend/girlfriend.

Good luck bro.",0
Dude this would probably be the last thing to do. She needs you,0
"I am so sorry that you are in this situation. This is something that I would be willing to do with a friend, but I do not think she will ever understand.  I would ask her to go see her mom and talk to her. Let her vent and talk to her in person. If she is not willing to go see her mom in person then you should talk to her parents. They may be able to help. I am so sorry this is happening to you. Please reach out to anyone you can think of. I wish you all the best.

"What the hell is wrong with this girl? Don't listen to her mother, that's what's wrong. 

Tell her mom that you aren't responsible for how she feels. Tell her that your girlfriend is in a bad place and you're trying to help her through it, but that you can't just be there for her 24/7. 

Also, you don't have to listen to her mother and your girlfriend. Her mother is talking to you because she knows you aren't going to leave her alone. She wants *you* to be part of the conversation because you need to be there when her mom breaks down and her mother needs to talk to you about it. 

She's not going to change her mind. If she doesn't want to talk to you she doesn't have to. 

I have a friend who had a kid and he kept telling me that I'm not going to be able to deal with this. I'm not talking to her anymore because I knew I was going to have to talk to her after a while. 

I would talk to her mom. Tell her that you are her friend and that you want her to know that your girlfriend is struggling with something and that you are willing to listen and be there for her, but that you are only going to be there for her when she wants to talk to you about it.

The thing is, her mom has no shame. She's not afraid to cry and she's not afraid to leave the situation or confront the person who caused her problems. 

Your girlfriend's mom is a coward and she's been a coward her whole life. She doesn't know how to deal with things. 

Talk to her mom. Have her talk to you first. Then have her talk to her dad. It'll get better.",0
"I can't tell you how badly I feel for you right now. This makes me so incredibly sad. I know how it's made you feel, I also know how hard it is to let go of someone you love. I hope you can somehow find some closure with her. It sounds like you love her a lot, but also that you really care about her and you feel like you can't be a good boyfriend anymore. 

I've been through a lot of break ups, and I'd be willing to bet you're in a pretty bad place right now. I would start by talking to her mom. Go find your girlfriend and tell her everything you've been telling us. Tell her you care about her and that you wish she could talk to you. Make sure she knows you care about her and about her mom. Tell her you're there if she needs you. That you want to talk to her. 

Also if you're going through a breakup with your boyfriend, maybe try to talk to him about it. Maybe he needs to talk to you. You'll both need to talk about it. 

I wish you the best of luck, and I hope one day you can find solace in being together.",0
"Hey man, sorry for you. I wish you the best, I understand completely.
I'm not sure I can give you advice because I don't know her family, but I know a couple of guys that you could talk to. I'd talk to the other guy, he's really open to it and I know that you like him.
Also, I'd think about going to a counselor. It's really hard to deal with these things on your own. 
I really hope you can talk to her mom and see if she cares. I hope she listens and will help you. 
And I'd really like to know how you can help her. Maybe you can call my work phone number to speak to someone? Or just contact me through text!
I hope you find a way to get the help and help that you need.
Take care",0

"*The Times* published a daily paper for about 80 years, from 1844 until 1966.  Their most important daily newspaper was The Times (London).  From 1844-1917 they published The Times (London).  Their other paper was the Evening Chronicle (Manchester).  From 1885-1933 they published The Evening Chronicle (London).  From 1934-1972 they published the Daily Herald, a tabloid type publication that was popular in the United Kingdom.

They were a huge empire.  

>The Times newspaper (TIM) was the only broadsheet newspaper in existence in Great Britain. It was a joint venture between The Times, and the Birmingham and Manchester papers, and was a direct competitor to the Times of London and The Times of Dublin. In the 1890s, the Telegraph became the only broadsheet newspaper in Great Britain apart from The Times in Dublin, and it was succeeded in that position by The Times (London). The Times was the only broadsheet newspaper in Great Britain to have a national circulation.

>The Times newspaper was a national broadsheet that was published daily in the British Isles and over much of the world.

People can't say anything about it though because it's not reported. So what they have to do is create a system where reporting it is encouraged.

Round 3: Saitama still has to take out the Hulk and the Hulkbuster, and then he will be in danger. Thanos, however, can beat up Saitama. Saitama is just going to need to go with the flow, take out the Hulk as soon as possible and then win by going for the head.

Round 4, the only thing that makes this fight interesting is having every character at once. If every one of them was on Saitama's level and had some prep then they wouldn't even need to fight. Saitama can beat anything he needs just by being there.",0
"R1: Saitama isn't even a match for most of the Marvel heroes. He's just a kid that can only go toe to toe with the villains he's already defeated.

"A metal-like material will have a chemical composition that is very similar to that of the metal.  To detect a change in that composition without a metal, you would need to use a catalyst to separate the metal from the rest of the material.",0
"The easiest way to detect chemical changes is to take a sample of some sample, let's say, a piece of aluminum foil. You can take this piece of aluminum foil and stick it in a vacuum chamber to cool it down to around absolute zero, then attach some sort of detector to this piece of foil.  

This vacuum chamber is basically a vacuum chamber which is not perfectly sealed. When you take the foil out of the vacuum chamber, you will see a lot of light. This light is from the foil, and represents the molecules (electrons) in the foil which are scattered off of the vacuum.  

When you take this piece of foil out of the vacuum chamber, you then take it and stick it in a magnet to give it a dip in the ground. By sticking the magnet on the piece of foil, it will emit a magnetic field which will then interact with the electrons in the foil in such a way that it will attract some of the electrons (and thus the electrons will be attracted to the magnets) and cause the electrons to scatter off of each other. This happens for some reason the further you move away from the magnet.  

After you have made the dip in the ground, you stick the piece of foil in your detector and watch the light from the light emitting electrons.  

You can monitor the dip in the ground for some time, and then decide whether or not the dip in the ground is going to continue. If the dip in the ground remains the same, the dip in the ground is indicating that the piece of foil is not going to get any closer to the magnet. If the dip in the ground goes by a significant amount, you know that the magnet is going to get closer. This is because the magnet is attracting the electrons in the foil. You can therefore conclude that the magnet will get closer.",0
"You can use a mass spectrometer to do this. In this case, you'd be looking for a change in the mass spectrum of the sample. You can determine this by measuring the amount of a chemical that is present in the sample, then compare it to what you found in the mass spectrometer.",0
"The way that you can detect a chemical change is by looking at the [reaction spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_spectrum) of the sample. This is typically a function of the [metal content] which is dependent of the [element content] (see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reaction_spectra_of_annealed_Aluminum#/media/File:Reaction_spectra_of_a_pond_slide_in_Aluminum.svg) for an example).

If you know what the temperature/temperature gradient is for the reaction you can measure how much of the metals are present in the sample, and from that calculate the amount of the metal present per unit volume.",0
"yes, it's possible to detect a chemical change in a material. If you have the metal, you should be able to measure it by looking at its [molecular mass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass#Abandonment). 

Also, metals are fairly stable, so if you have some sample of metal, you should be able to take it apart and find out what the metal is.",0
"To the best of my knowledge, a chemical change is not a physical event. The change occurs in the material, not in the atom. You could, in theory, measure the chemical composition of the aluminum, and then calculate the mass of the metal by knowing the mass of the metal atoms.

If you had an atom of pure aluminum, with no other atoms in the sample, it would just be a pile of atoms.",0
"You could use something like the [pyrrhoton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyry_photons_detector), but that's a whole nother story.",0
This is actually one of the most important issues that gets overlooked by the materials research community. What is this called? The chemical bond-pairing? The [Bodman-Fock law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodman%E2%80%93Fock_law) ?,0
"A few decades ago, we had a lot of trouble with metals.  That's part of why we developed the [Stoner's Scale](http://www.chemicalsecrets.com/stoners-scale.html) in the first place.

I'm not sure that there's a good way to determine metal by looking at the chemical composition of the metal, but there are chemical sensors that will detect metal and will tell you when a metal is present.",0
"There are two methods.

1. In the case of a metal, an oxidation state can be detected by its melting point. For example, pure aluminum alloys are white-gray because of their low melting point.

2. A property of a material can be detected using a spectrum of different wavelengths. These are usually referred to as spectroscopic measurements. For example, the melting point of pure aluminum can be determined by studying the spectrum of light that hits the aluminum.

It is generally easier to study a material by using it in a vacuum.",0
"There are a lot of chemical properties of metals (and other materials) that are easily detectable (e.g. [this](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369265415003247).)

"I think it's more of a problem of who you ask. For example the Celtics were formed in 1957, but was started by a team in 1948. To answer this question, you might want to ask who the founding members of the Celtics were. 

The Warriors are another example. It's a team based in Oakland, but was started in 1980 by a team in San Francisco. So again, would you know who started the Warriors?

In the NBA you can also ask about the origin of the NBA. Many of the first stars in the NBA have ties to China, and the NBA was started in China in 1947. I don't know if there are more stories about the origins of the NBA, but I'm sure you can still find some interesting ones on Wikipedia.

She had a very young mother, she was very caring for her child. 
I would have had doubts about the mother's story. 
She was in no way a risk to the child's safety.

To be honest, the mother was pretty strange. 
The woman was very angry with the child, the child was very young and she was not old enough to take care of her. 
I believe the woman was trying to hurt the child, 
I do not believe the child was being taken by anyone.

If the child was kidnapped by a stranger, the mother was not the right person to take the child.

​",0
"I always thought if a child is taken, it's because of neglect or abuse. The father isn't in jail yet, so it's more understandable for the mom to be acting this way.

It's a good documentary, but I don't think any of his interviews are really worth watching.

I really dislike his interviews and his use of the word ""weee"" a lot of the time. I just don't like when people refer to themselves as weee.

The most compelling parts of the documentary to me were the interviews with the other parents. They were always very detailed, and they gave a very good idea of the mother not having a lot of contact with the child. The child seemed happy with his/her family. 

I don't want to give anything away, but the kid seems to have very good memories of being a tot.",0
"I am watching the film right now. I thought the documentary was incredible and really gave a good perspective into the case.

It's a very long documentary but there is a lot of information and a good amount of information that's pretty eye-opening. So much so that I don't think it's a good idea to watch it without a good understanding of the case in the background.

I can understand the mother not wanting the child to see people, even if she's not the one who's at work, and the fact that she's leaving the child alone alone is also understandable. 

However, I would also like to add some more information about the case. The mother was apparently known to have a pretty bad temper. Also, the mother was known for being pretty shady in the past. I do believe that if the child was taken by a stranger, the mother would still take the child out of the house. 

The mother says the child was taken by a stranger in the area, but the child was actually in the vicinity of the mother's home, on the side of the street, at the time of the abduction. It's not a stretch I can see to say that the child was either taken by someone else or possibly the child was abducted by the mother herself. 

Also, the mother was supposed to have a child in a month with another man. I don't think she was that serious with the family and I can't see the mother taking the child out of the house. 

I think that if the child is not in the care of the mother, the child is in either very bad condition, or dead.",0

It's a story about a man who really wants to be a fisherman and his life is turned upside down when he discovers a giant creature that he has no idea about. I don't think he had any idea about it since he is a fisherman. 

It's a very good movie.",0

"If the only way you can defeat fascism is to use your guns against fascists, then you are very slow to defeat fascism.

That's like saying that you should just drop napalm bombs on any building that you see in the middle of a warzone so that you can destroy a bunch of fascists' homes and then hope that the fascists will just surrender without a fight because they are going to be bombed to death anyway. 

>I'm not making this up. This is a direct quote from a fascist talking about how to deal with a communist takeover.

This is the way fascists act. They don't make up quotes anymore, they just go ""I know you are, but what am I?""",0

We should learn from the greatest totalitarian state in history.,0
I hate the fact that there are so many capitalist propaganda stations in this world.,0
It's happening in the US already. You're not going to find a socialist in the US that isn't immediately labeled a communist. Just look at Venezuela.,0

What's to stop a totalitarian state from completely erasing history and replacing it with lies and propaganda?",0
"I think one of the most important things to keep in mind as socialists is the power of education.  If we are to succeed, we have to be able to reach people in as many ways as we can.  Even though I personally don't have the expertise to answer your question, I can think of at least five or six ways you can educate people.


* Educate your students.  We are taught from the start to be critical thinkers and to think for ourselves, and when we fail to do so the whole class suffers.  In addition, a lot of people have learned that they need to stand up for themselves and fight injustice and bad ideas.  This is an important lesson that will serve to educate you.


* Teach your students that there is no such thing as ""the system"".  Everyone has a role to play in creating a better world.  No one has the answers, so we should all be able to participate in the process.  This can be taught through discussion, debate, and organizing.  Again, you need to be able to explain why your proposed change is important, and what alternatives there are.  This can be taught through discussion, debate, and organizing.


* I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but it is a bit of a problem in America and people often equate socialism and communism.  They tend to be very ignorant of the differences between those two.  What I mean is, communism isn't a set of very specific and rigid ideas as socialism is.  Both of them are about creating a better world for the people in it.  How we do that is a matter of debate.


* You want your students to be active in the community.  Many schools have programs that will allow your students to volunteer at their schools or even to go on a field trip to a local church so that they can learn a lot about what socialism is.  This can also be taught through discussion, debate, and organizing.",0
"I think the main thing that has stopped totalitarianism is the existence of capitalism. If the people are starving and the government is stealing their food and resources, I believe that will turn people and the state against one another. The state will need to be replaced, and the capitalists will need to be stopped.",0
The thing that you have to learn when discussing the subject of history in the current political climate is that history is not written by the victor (capitalism) but by the defeated (communism).,0
"The world is still going through the process of building socialism, and these people believe that if the people of the world would just come together and peacefully build Communism we could have it by 2020.",0
We are still learning.,0
"There is, unfortunately, nothing. The only way for history to be rewritten is to either force them back into the box of the state, or to destroy the state.",0
"If people were so worried about their national identity being erased and replaced by propaganda, wouldn't we all be dead?",0

"If she gets her way, she's going to end up marrying Khal Drogo again.",0
"I don't really buy it, but it's certainly fun to speculate on the possibility. 

This is not the first time the reader has had to come to terms with certain things. In the first book Catelyn Stark had to go back with her sister to King's Landing to be married, and after that they were both married. In the second book Arya had to go to Braavos in order to be taken as some sort of hostage by the Faceless Men and her sister was the Faceless Man's agent. In the third book Dany had to run away away to Meereen to be a hostage. She might be the only character that has to go to a different continent to be a hostage. 

So I would say I think it is more likely it's just a plot device than anything else.",0
"I'm pretty sure it's because she's trying to be Daenerys, and a Targ means having the Targaryen trait, so she's not really Daenerys.",0
"I think the big question is if Dany will have an ""end"" to her story.

If her story is ending, it's because of her decision to end it. If she stays, I think there's a possibility that it'll continue in a different form.

I think if we're still in the same timeline, Dany will marry the new Targ, but I suspect we won't be seeing much of that marriage.",0
"It's too early to say. I assume the story will not go anywhere, and after the books are out, we'll get to read what happened in the 5 year gap, and if it's bad, let's read the next books. 


Dany seems to be the main character, and her story is still the most important one. She's the only one who can change the past, and she's the one who will be the most important character to the story going forward.",0
"If it's the end of the story, then yes, it is a possible foreshadow. 

As for the other scenario, it is not really a foreshadow at all. This would be a story about someone living their life. It could be a story about someone returning from a long trip, or about losing a loved one. Dany is going to go back to Astapor. That is the only story this could be. Not necessarily because they want her to marry the new Targ, but because they want to have a story. Her story will have to end with her living her life.",0
You are reading too much into it. Dany in the books is quite pragmatic and only sees things as black and white because she is a character that is not given a lot of insight into her own motives and thoughts. I don't think the showrunners want to make a long journey to where Dany is going. They want her to come back and see the world and deal with it. But the book will end with her marrying Drogo for love and the story is over. Dany will return to Westeros to marry another guy and then get back on her way.,0
"Dany's story ends the same way her last chapter starts.  She returns to Daznak's pit, she returns to her people, and she returns to the House of the Undying.  Her story is going to be much like her last chapter in the show, and her story is going to be much like her last chapter in the books.",0
"There's been a lot of speculation in this sub about what's going to happen in the next book, but I don't think there's much to go on.  We know that Dany will be heading back to Westeros, and will be married to a new Targ.  What about the rest of the story?

1.  We know that Dany is going to be in Essos for a large portion of the future.  The timeline for that is still sort of vague.  Could she be married/born in Westeros, but then head back to Westeros at some point?  That would make sense if Dany's first chapter was in Westeros (i.e. she was there before leaving for Essos), but the next chapter of the next book is in Essos.
2.  It's been speculated that Dany will be married off to Drogo when she returns to Westeros.  We don't know that's what's going to happen.  It definitely could be.
3.  The other possibility is that, after Dany's return to Westeros, she is told by Viserys that she was to wed for love, and she could choose to go back to the Dothraki Sea and have children with Drogo.  But even then, I don't think that's what's going to happen.  In fact, I don't think that's what will happen at all.  Drogo dies at the end of the books, and Dany marries the man that killed him.  There doesn't seem to be any plan for Dany to marry off to another man after that.

I don't think there's much of a storyline there.  We just kind of assume that there's going to be some story to follow, but I honestly have no idea what it's going to be.  I think that's what we're all waiting for.",0
"It was my turn to be the little spoon.

I took the first bite.

""Mmmm, just like Mommy used to make...""

The girl in the white coat leaned over the table to kiss my cheek.

""Mommy would be so proud of you, sweetheart. Now you can go make your father happy.""

The girl in the white coat was the prettiest girl I'd ever met. She had long black hair, and a beautiful smile. I loved the way she looked.

I loved the way her eyes lit up when she heard her name.

""I'm so proud of you.""",0

"Hi I'm not a scientist.  But I'll try to help you out.

​

No, you would not be born with the ability to hear sound.  You would have to develop the ability to hear sound.  

​

The human brain doesn't have a very good way of understanding sound, so your hearing ability is going to start out very low.  It's highly unlikely that you'll go deaf from very early on in life, but it's still conceivable.  

​

I could be wrong about this, but I have heard that it's possible for people who have very rare mutations in one of their genes, or who live in conditions where their hearing is severely damaged, to develop hearing loss and/or deafness. 

​

It's still a matter of a) how severe the hearing loss is and b) the type of hearing loss.  If the person has mild hearing loss (e.g. a ringing in the ears), but their ability to hear sound is severely affected, they can develop hearing loss and/or deafness.  

​

That's the basis for the hearing loss and deafness tests you see on TV and in movies.  But the hearing loss and deafness tests are not very accurate.  

​

Also, the hearing tests are not particularly useful for understanding how sound is affected by the environment.  

​

To get a better understanding of how sound is affected by the environment, I would recommend you do some research on acoustics and otorhinolaryngology.",0

"Dumbbell shoulder press and dumbbell shoulder press are dumbbell shoulder presses.

Don't do both.",0
"I think you could benefit from a strength program like 5/3/1, as long as you're not too uncomfortable with the number of sets.

I'd recommend adding a few of the compound movements. I'd say that even if you're just starting, try doing some squats, deadlifts, and shoulder press as well as the dumbbell shoulder press. If you're feeling too sore for the shoulder press, you could replace it with something like bent-over dumbbell shoulder press. 

Also, I'd suggest getting a full body fitness program that's designed for beginners, rather than 5/3/1 because it doesn't include a lot of compound movements. You could start with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/z4cvo/a_complete_workout_program_based_on_body_fat_%C0%A0/), and then you can add the compound movements that you want to.

Edit: Also, some people have trouble with the high volume of 5/3/1. 5/3/1 is a great program for beginners that's meant to be done in 3-5 days per week, so adding another day would probably not be too much of a problem. However, I'd recommend doing a few exercises each day and making sure that you're not getting burned out.",0
"1) I would recommend just doing barbell bench press with a normal barbell and a neutral grip. 

2) Start with a lighter weight than you are used to and make sure you are very tense throughout the movement.",0
"You should be doing heavy weight and sets for compound movements. I suggest you do the following:

* Bench Press: 70% of your working weight (so you're doing 5 sets of 6 reps).
* Barbell Row: 70% of your working weight (so you're doing 5 sets of 8-12 reps).
* Barbell Curl: 75-80% of your working weight (so you're doing 5 sets of 10-12 reps).
* Bench Press: 80-85% of your working weight (so you're doing 5 sets of 12-15 reps).
* Barbell Curl: 85-90% of your working weight (so you're doing 5 sets of 12-15 reps).
* Face Pulls (with a weight that you can do 10 reps): 80% of working weight (so you're doing 10 sets of 10-12 reps).
* Incline Dumbbell Curls: 80-85% of your working weight (so you're doing 10 sets of 10-12 reps).
* Facepulls: 80-85% of your working weight (so you're doing 10 sets of 10-12 reps).

Now, you're doing heavy weight, so you're probably exhausted after each set. But you're also building strength, so try to do another set or two.

You can also do a 5x5 style program, where you do different exercises in a week.

Good luck!",0
"1.  A great supplement to any program is foam rolling.  It's one of the best ways to avoid tight spots, imo.
2.  A lot of people recommend deadlifts, but I personally don't like them because I think they're kinda 'too much' for beginner weight lifters.
3.  Do you have an incline bench? I personally prefer them over flat benches.
4.  I personally prefer dumbbells, but I'm definitely not going to make excuses.  Dumbbells are better for isolation exercises as opposed to barbells, but I wouldn't call them useless.",0

"The computer engine has a rating as high as it can go for each move. After each move it gets a rating based on the positions before the move. The rating is a measure of the strength of the engine's search algorithm. So the rating for White would be based on the position after the move 20, and the rating for Black would be based on the position after the move 10.

So when the engine evaluates White's position after 20, it sees that White got to move 20, and it wants to evaluate White's next move to see what advantage White has. Therefore, it looks at the next move of Black before White's. If Black's move is worse, the engine says, ""White's advantage is even greater.""",0
"The advantage is made because you have the center. In every other case, White goes into the center, White has a clear advantage.

The advantage is made because black's position is completely broken. Black has a couple of moves that are in the middle of the board, but can't do anything to stop White from taking the center. Black can't castle, has a bunch of pawns that can be exchanged for no good reason, and cannot do anything to keep his king safe during the middle game.

White's advantage at this point can't be explained. It's not just the fact that Black has to move to get in the center. White's advantage is just that white's position is better than what Black's position was at move 20. It's the difference that makes it so good.",0
"One question: what do you mean by ""advantage""? Are you talking about the advantage the computer has? Or are you referring to the advantage you are having? Because if you're talking about the computer's advantage, then it will be impossible for the computer to calculate the position of the king and make moves that lead to the computer's advantage.

I can't really answer your question, but if you're talking about the advantage you have, then the advantage the computer has is not that big because it's a computer.",0
"I think the computer's position is actually a trap. Black has a large advantage in the center, and black is clearly better off on the queenside.

If black were to play the standard opening move of 21.g4, he could be in great shape, though the black king would eventually have an advantage on the central files. But the computer's move 18.f4 is a trap. 19.Nd5 is bad, but it's not clear where the black king could go. 20.Bg2 is a forced attack, because 21.Nf8 is a perpetual check for black. 21.f4 is the best move, because it allows black to play 21.Nf8, and the computer has to give up a piece.

The computer's choice to play 17.Bxg2 is just about the only move that White is clearly better off, and black's position is very bad.

The computer's choice to play 16.g4 is a good move. It allows white to play 16.Nf3, which is a forced attack. Black has no plan after 16.Nf3, and the computer has to give up a piece.

17.Be3 is bad, because it allows white to play 17.Bh6, which is a perpetual check.

18.Bd2 is bad, and will allow white to play 18.Bh6, and the computer has to give up a piece.

The computer's choice to play 16.b3 is just about the only move that Black is clearly better off. Black's position is very bad. 16.Bxg2 is the best move, because the computer has to give up a piece.",0
The main factor is the fact that black is down a pawn and his best response is to trade his one pawn for his opponent's -1.,0

* I would consider a joint account to be the same as having a separate account. You can keep that account for your own use, or you can decide to take that account, and then have access to the partner's account for your own use.
* You can also have a ""joint bank account,"" that is separate from both your personal account and your partner's personal account. This allows you to do things like withdraw money from the partner's account, but doesn't affect access to your own account.

3) You need to decide if you want to start a fund that has a higher potential return. You can start a non-market fund. I would recommend looking into Vanguard Total Stock Market fund.

4) Once you have your new fund set up then you can start playing around with the markets.

5) Once you are comfortable with that you can start trading. For now just trade USD and do it small. Do not trade stocks you do not understand. You will need a good trading strategy before you can get big.",0

I can see why people might enjoy it, but I thought it was a very strange and contrived movie, and it took me out of it. The biggest problem I had with this film was the main character. Her name is Celia, and she's a ""strong, independent woman"" in spite of her husband's addiction to alcohol. At first I thought it was a parody of that type of character and I thought it was hilarious, but then I got into the plot and it just felt like a cheap attempt at making a ""strong, independent woman"" who is abusive, manipulative, and controlling.

It's not that she's a bad character, but I didn't really care about her being angry at her husband or why she did it. I felt like she was just a way for Tarantino to make a female protagonist that he can really show off the ""badass"" qualities of by having her act like that, but I don't know if that's just a Tarantino thing, or if it's just me.",0
"There are too many westerns that the Tarantino western is already too hard to make. This movie is my favorite Tarantino western. I think it can be compared to a lot of his other work. It has a lot of characters, some of which are very memorable, but you could say the main character here is the main character of most of his movies. I think people who consider this movie ""the best"" are either Tarantino fans, or people who are only familiar with his work outside of the western genre, and I think most people in both categories would agree with this movie's popularity. I'm not sure who is considered the best western, but I think this movie is extremely interesting and fun. This movie is a Tarantino western. It's not that weird, in the sense that most westerns are. It's a Tarantino western to me, and I would consider it a Tarantino western because it definitely is a Tarantino western.",0
"I think you are going to answer a lot of people's questions (I'm one of them), but I wanted to add a few points of my own:

1. Tarantino has always been an outspoken critic of Hollywood Westerns, and has always made a point of saying that his westerns are not just ""a movie"", but an art form, a visual genre, and a way for the audience to engage with the story. I think that the most significant difference between Tarantino and other Hollywood Westerns is his focus on the story, not just the action. 

2. Tarantino's use of practical effects could have been the same way when he made *Death Proof*, but he changed the way he handled his scenes, and it made sense with what he was trying to achieve.

3. Tarantino is a big fan of 35mm. He was a cinematographer when he was younger, and when he moved on he began to use 35mm for his own scenes, and the scenes with Tarantino.

4. Tarantino used a lot of practical effects in this movie. It is not the same as a Hollywood Western, but a Western nonetheless.

5. Tarantino loved the movie. He loved it so much that he made a sequel.

6. Tarantino used the western formula. The story line is the same, the action is the same, the characters are the same. I think he was very aware of the many ways that was not the case.",0
"Well, Tarantino obviously has a soft spot for it, but he's definitely talking in circles here. The only real way to know if a film is a western is to watch the *""what is a western?""* test, and if you failed that test, it's not a western.",0

"""Hey, you heard me, we're going to the bar!""

""You heard me, I'm going to the bar, and this girl is going to be my hookup!""

""No! No way, man! This is a stupid idea. I've been in the bar for three weeks and you don't even know where it's going!""

""I do, man, and this girl's going to be my hookup!""

This wasn't working, though. ""You didn't even tell me where it's going! I'm going to the bar to buy a new car and I'm not going to ask anyone for directions, either!""

""Okay, I'm going to go get my car. I'm going to the bar and I'm going to ask this girl to drive me around for a bit!""

""Good for you, though! I'm going to have to leave work early because of you! You're going to get the girl if you keep this up!""

""I will!""

""Yes, you will!""

The two men walked into the bar. Two seats down from the booth where the girl was sitting, a guy had his hands folded across his lap. He was pretty young, maybe just out of high school. He was pretty drunk, his face was smothered in cheap beer, and he was pretty obviously wasted. It was a good thing he didn't notice them.

""Hey, I'm so drunk that I thought you were a stranger,"" said the guy.

""Hey, I'm just going to get my car,"" said the girl. She turned to the guy and gave him a wink. ""And that's a good way to get my attention, yeah?""

""Yeah, I'm pretty much ready to bust out of the bar and go on my way. You got a phone number for the girl I'm meeting?""

""Yeah, her name's Jess.""

""Okay, thanks.""

""Sure thing,"" said the guy. ""Let's do this.""

They sat down at the booth where the girl was sitting, and he started talking to her. ""Hey, I heard you're really into me,"" he said. ""I've got a car if you need it, but I'm not going to go out here to borrow it. Just let me know when you're close.""

""Yeah, I'm sure I'm going to be able to drive for a little bit,"" said the girl.

""Okay, I'll send you a message when I'm out of breath, then.""

""Awesome!"" said the guy, as he started to walk away. They stared at each other for a few seconds, and then the girl started to get up.

""Oh my god, I'm so drunk that I'm going to pass out in the car!""

The man turned to the girl. ""Hey, man, we'll go to your car. I'll just throw some stuff on the passenger seat and we'll go.""

""No, I'm not driving. Just let me get the keys.""

""Okay, thanks.""

The girl got up and walked over to the car. She sat in the passenger seat, her hands in her lap, and her face was covered in so much alcohol that it was hard to tell what she was doing. She was walking towards the driver's seat, and the guy was starting to get up from behind the wheel of his car.

""Hey, this is weird, man"" said the girl. ""Why are you just driving?!""

""I don't understand,"" said the man. ""I don't know what the hell I'm doing!""

""Oh, that's it, man!"" said the girl. She leaned forward and stuck her tongue out at the man. ""You're the worst kind of drunk! I'm drunk and I can't drive!""

""I'm sorry, I'm so drunk I can't even drive!"" cried the man.

""Yeah, I'm not even drunk!"" the girl cried. ""I'm so drunk, I'm going to pass out in my car!""

""I'm not driving,"" said the man. ""I'm leaving.""

""You're leaving?"" shouted the girl, and her voice was almost drowned out into the bar.

The guy started to drive away. ""I'm so drunk I'm going to pass out in my car!""

When the guy had driven away, the girl slumped forward and started crying. She leaned into her seat and covered her face in her hands.",0
"
A man sat across from a young woman in an empty classroom. The man, whose name was John, was a physicist, working on a project to alter the laws of time. The young woman was his daughter, Hannah.

The young woman was nervous, and John smiled. ""Don't you see,"" he said, ""this is going to be fun. I can change anything. So, what time is it? You look like you're about to go to bed, but you're still here. So, let's just do this, and maybe we can get some sleep, if you want.""

Hannah nodded, and John turned out the lights.

""I've got a good start on changing the world!"" John exclaimed. ""The first thing I'm going to do is change the world's time. Let's get started!""

The young woman stared at him in shock, then began to laugh nervously. John shook his head, and walked away.

Hannah sat down and studied his face, trying to recall some of his old jokes. She had gotten a lot better at memorizing jokes recently. She couldn't remember any of the old ones, but she tried anyway, because she had seen how much he had improved since he first started the experiment.

""How old are you anyway?"" asked a new student.

The young woman looked around nervously.

""I just graduated college,"" she said. ""I'm twenty eight. My hair is grey, and I got a big belly, but I'm still twenty eight.""

The new student chuckled nervously.

""How old are you?"" asked the first grader.

Hannah started laughing, and the new student stood up nervously.

""Well, I'm twenty three. And I'm the oldest one here. And the reason I'm standing up is because my dad's taking me to a bar!""",0
"In the end, they had only one thing to prove, and that was the world. Everyone, at the end of their days, was faced with the same decision, whether to accept and live in this world of chaos or to accept and live in the world of order. 

This world of chaos had been created by a man named Richard, a man who had created it. He had created it as he saw fit, and he had only one goal in mind: to prove to the world that he had created this world with the sole purpose of saving it. 

For years, this world had been a constant battle with the humans to create order. Richard had made a new world to fit his plan, created a world of chaos, and slowly, over time, the humans had created a world of order. 

The humans were the ones who had created the world, but the humans were not the ones who created it. The humans had created the chaos, they had created the order.

The humans had created order, but the humans were not the one who created chaos. 

The humans had created chaos... 

Richard had been the one who had created chaos. He had created order, he had created chaos. But, the humans had created chaos. They had created chaos. They had created chaos. They had created chaos.

It was impossible for the humans to prove that Richard had created chaos through chaos, because they had created chaos through chaos. They had created chaos, they had created chaos, and they had created chaos. Every last one of them. 

The humans had created chaos, but they had created chaos. 

And then, finally, Richard had stopped. The world had become a calm place. A world where the humans had lost their war and chaos had won. 

The humans had created chaos, but they had created chaos.

"They said its impossible. People have been doing it for centuries, and they call it the time loop. 

""It's not impossible,"" I responded. ""In fact, it's pretty easy to do.""

We sat in an old building filled with old desks and old clocks; old, dusty computers sat before us. 

""So, how do you do it?"" he asked. 

""You just do it,"" I said, in a matter-of-fact way.

He smiled. ""Okay, then. How do we do it?""

""We go to the place we remember from the time loop,"" I replied. ""We have the memory, the memories, all the memories. It's like the place we're in now, but we never left it.""

""So, how do we do it?""

I felt a sense of tension in the air.

""We do it!"" I shouted. ""We go to the place we were in the time loop. That's easy.""

I paused and looked across the room at him. 

He was looking at the floor, hands on his knees, head bowed. 

""So, how do we do it?"" he asked again.

""We do it!"" I shouted. ""We go to the place we were in the time loop!""

I started to walk towards the door, but stopped and turned around.

""What if they come back?"" he asked.

""What if? What if they don't come back?"" I replied.

He looked at me and grinned. ""Well, they might come back. What if the time loop starts over, but all the same people are in it?""

""What if,"" I said, ""but what if they don't come back?""

""What if they don't come back,"" he said.

"It was a dull, grey day all throughout the town. Not that the town had much to do, it was the usual run of the mill dull grey grey town, but the dull grey grey day was different. It was the day that the sun had disappeared, and it was the day that everything changed.

The sun had disappeared, and all other days had become boring. For the first time in forever, the town was quiet.

"I had been searching for the lost dog for 2 weeks. The dog had been lost for 2 weeks. They hadn't found him until 2 weeks after I had found him. I was looking everywhere and I knew I'd found him, but I wasn't sure. I had searched so much that my dog wasn't allowed to go out, and I was too worried about her walking off into the woods to do it myself. When I had found him, I hadn't found him. I didn't really know what to do, but I couldn't just give up. I was going to find him.  I was going to find the dog. I was going to be there. 

I was so worried about the dog, I'd never had a dog before. I didn't want to break any rules, but I couldn't just leave them in the woods. Especially not with a big dog, who would be able to find it quickly. I wasn't going to let the dog wander off, and I wasn't willing to risk her walking straight into the woods. 

I had been out there for a few hours now, and I couldn't find the dog. I wasn't sure if he was lost or not. I hadn't seen him walk in the woods. I had seen him walk in the woods, but I didn't think he was lost. I had never seen a dog like that before, and I wasn't sure how he had managed it. I had a feeling that he was lost, but I still had a lot more searching to do. 

I hadn't seen any tracks. I had seen a couple of signs, but not any tracks. Even if I did see tracks, I had to be careful. I had to be careful that the dog wouldn't get lost or hurt by the tracks. I wasn't certain if they had them, but it was one of my greatest fears. 

The last time the dog was seen, he was walking back into the woods. He was walking back into the woods when he saw me. He was so happy to see me, that his eyes were half open. He was so happy that he was back in the woods, that he jumped up and down. I was so happy that I had found him. 

I knew that I had to go looking for him. I didn't want to risk running into them again, but I couldn't just leave him in the woods. 

The woods were so hard to find. It was so hard to find a trail when it was so hard to find the trail in the first place. I wanted to go, but I had to be careful. I had to be careful that he wouldn't get lost again. I still had to be careful. 

I was going to be careful. I was going to be careful. I was going to be careful. I was going to be careful.

I couldn't stand it anymore, and I ran out that front door and looked all around. Nothing. I sighed and headed home. 

Two weeks later, I finally found her in the same spot where I had lost her. She was curled up into the same little spot I had last seen her. I was so relieved to have found her, and to know that she could be found!",0
"I looked at the clock. It was just after 12. That was the time I'd started out on this mission. My friend and I had set out to find our lost dog, but the terrain was still unfamiliar, and despite the best of my planning, we had to make due with the least amount of gear that we could muster. 

I hadn't even had time to pack my bags before I stumbled upon our lost dog, an old grey hound. Not only had we found him, we'd found the most promising lead we had. We had to hurry. We had to find the trail, and the rest of the town. 

I pulled a pair of hiking boots out of my bag, and quickly dusted off my pack, stuffing it with a small pack of snacks and water. I'd have to get going. It was my turn to be on a mission.

The old hound's head was still facing north, and the moonlight filtered through the trees, shining on his wrinkled coat and the trail ahead of us. It was a beautiful night, and I was hoping for a quiet night, with only the occasional creak of branches and the rustling of the leaves in the wind. I was ready to take out the hound and start the hike back home. 

The pack I'd brought on the hike was filled with tools of various kinds, small and large, and I had to make due with what I had. Since we'd lost sight of him, I'd brought an axe, a shovel, a spade, and two of my favorite cans of bear spray. I put them all on my back, and started walking.

I took all of one step into the woods before I felt a sharp pain in my side. It was a cold, sharp pain, and my heart was beating in my chest. I'd forgotten to bring my bear spray with me, and the sun was already beginning to set. I turned my head and tried to ignore the sharp, stabbing pain in my side, trying to focus on my hike.

I looked over my shoulder to the trail ahead of us. The ground was soft, and I could barely make out the trail. It was a trail that I knew I'd used to hike in the early spring before the snow began to fall. I knew I'd gone this way, and I knew I'd been hiking this way for years. I knew I'd taken the same trail before.

I turned back to look at the path I had walked for over 100 miles that night. My hand was covered in blood, red and stinging, and there was some blood on the trail ahead of us. I quickly wiped the trail before my friend, who was just coming up behind me. 

I turned in the opposite direction, and we followed the trail. As we followed it, the moonlight was shining on the trail, and I could see the outline of a large black silhouette behind a tree line. I thought it might be a bear, but I wasn't afraid. I looked up into the trees, and saw nothing. I quickly turned back to look for my friend, and my friend was already over the tree line. I glanced at him, and we both started to run. 

I reached the clearing, and we sprinted as fast as we could to the house. It was an old house, one of those old houses where the porch was on the side of the house, and the rest of the house was a single story. The porch was a few feet from the road, so we quickly got out of the car and ran the last few steps to the house.

We had to get the dog, and we had to get home. With my friend beside me, I ran as fast as I could through the back yard, to the porch. The windows were all boarded up, and the front door was just about to be open. I looked back to find the path I had walked the night before. We ran to it. There was nothing in sight.

I looked up. I looked behind. I looked at the house. I looked at the dog. I looked at my friend. I looked at the dog's head. I looked at all of my friends in the house. 

I looked up.

*Awww, he's cute.*",0
"The search party was at the house, the siren wailing the only sound as the last of the men broke into the door. When they entered the house, they saw a man in a mask, a hatchet in his hand and a scowling expression on his face. 

""What the hell do you want"" the men asked, one of them standing. 
  
""Get on your knees and give me the key,"" the man spat. ""I will give you one chance to save your dog.""",0
"I'm sitting in my living room, staring at the TV, watching the news. All of a sudden, some sort of explosion sounds off. A few moments later, there's a fire.

I start to feel sick and my pulse starts to pick up. I pull up the remote and turn the TV off. I check on my pets and start to head outside.

I look up and see a fireball in my kitchen, and I jump and run to the couch. My stomach churns and I can't stop thinking about what just happened.

I look over at my cats and see that they aren't in the kitchen, and I grab the remote and turn the TV back on.

""The explosion has just happened, and now the fire is in your house!""

""What do you mean?""

""There's smoke in the house that you didn't have before!""

I put the TV back on. It's just a bit too loud for me to sleep. I start to walk back into the kitchen, when I hear the fire alarm. 

I reach for the remote and turn it off. I start to get up and run to the front door. I open it and get on my hands and knees. I turn the TV on and start to look for the fire.

I hear the sound of the water alarm go off, and I look at the TV.

""There's a fire in your apartment!""",0
"""Come on, don't you know where your dog is?""

He had been gone two weeks now. It was a strange time for him, and it was hard for him to find his way. He was searching for his lost dog. 

""Yes I do, but I can't find him""

""Maybe he ran away?""

""No, he's probably just running around the neighborhood""

""Maybe he's hiding in someone's yard?""

""No... I'm sure he's not. I've searched all over with my feet, and I can't find him anywhere""

""Maybe he's in the backyard? Who's house is that?""

""Well, I don't know that much about that kind of stuff,"" he said.

""Maybe he ran away...""

""NO! He wasn't going to that house!""

""He's probably just running around the street...""

""Maybe he's in someone's yard...""

""No,"" he said. ""He wasn't. He's probably in the neighbor's yard...""

They had searched and searched and searched. The woods, the backyards, the yards of neighbors, and the neighborhood. 

They hadn't found anyone. They'd never seen him before. They had searched and searched, and searched and searched. But he hadn't come back. No one had seen him. He wasn't coming back. They were starting to get desperate. They had searched every yard, neighborhood, and even a couple houses over. They had even searched the neighbors' yards. Every time they had looked, they had gotten nowhere. 

It was starting to get late, and they had to go.

""I'm really starting to get desperate""

""I think you're over thinking this""

They stopped in the backyard. The neighbors' yard was a tree, and he was starting to get really scared.

""I'm really really scared""

""Let's go over to the neighbors' house and see if we can catch him""

""I want to see them!""

They went over to the neighbors' house. They went into the yard, and they could barely breathe.

""Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Are you looking for your dog?""

""Yes""

""No you are not""

""What's wrong with you?""

""Your dog, I mean. He's in the neighborhood isn't he?""

""No he's not. He's not in the neighbors yard...""

""Okay, well we're going to run down to the neighbors' house and see if we can catch him. Then we'll go home and go to sleep. And then we'll try to go to bed again tomorrow""

""No, you're not going to go to sleep tomorrow. You're not taking your dog with you. No, you're not going to go back into your yard. No, you're not going to do anything. You're just going to leave him here for us to try and find. We're going to try to go to sleep.""

""You can't do this.""

""I am doing this""

He was so scared. The neighbors were so scared. They were going to leave their yard, and he was going to leave his dog. And he just wanted to go to sleep. They just wanted to watch TV. He just wanted to sleep.

""I'm so scared""

""Well, you're going to have to leave""",0

"> I think you'll find that many of those involved in the Union were, in fact, Confederate sympathisers.

The Civil War is a war of nationalism. A man who was an abolitionist could have been a Civil War supporter.

> I am more worried about the fact that the American Civil War is, arguably, the greatest genocide in our nation's history.

This was not the primary cause of the Civil War. The cause of the War was slavery.

> Even more importantly, I think that the American Civil War is just one reason why racism and slavery are still an issue in our nation today.

This is your opinion and no one has the right to tell you what to think. 

> The main purpose of the Union armies was to preserve the Union. The purpose of the Confederacy was to destroy the United States.

If the Union was to destroy the United States then the Confederate States did not even exist. This is one way to look at it.

> This is not to say that the Confederacy was good, just that it was necessary.

No, the Confederate States were a war of secession. The Union did not exist and the war was not about preserving the Union. The only reason to secede was slavery.

> The South was in the process of being taken over by big capital.

The South was not taken over by big capital. The only reason that the South was taken over by big capital was because the South had a civil war. If the North had not had a civil war then the South would not have had a civil war. The South was not taken over because of big capital.

> I think that you're being too simplistic.

I am being too simplistic? I think that you are being too simplistic? Why? Because people who lived in the North thought the Civil War was about slavery, you think that people who lived in the South thought it was about keeping the Union together?",0

"I would just like to point out that while the Romans were in Egypt, they didn't actually establish a permanent presence there. They only set up a trade route that stretched across the Red Sea and was able to pass through the Sinai desert unharmed. The Romans' real impact on the Egyptian economy was in the form of the lucrative service of the Egyptian legions in the Roman armies, which would later become the basis of a permanent Roman presence in Egypt.",0
"First of all, the Romans did come to Egypt. They built Egypt's first walls around 55 BC, and the first city of Alexandria in 35 BC. By Caesar's time, Egypt was a Roman province.

The official name for Egypt was ""Egypto-Parthia"" (the land of the Parthians) - the Latin word *pars* means ""land"" or ""country"". There are many theories as to why the Romans called it ""Egypto-Parthia"", but some of the more common ones are:

* The Parthians were a nomad people who settled along the Euphrates, and the Mediterranean coast area was not their homeland. In order to keep the area under control, they named it something like that, to make it feel more ""Roman"".

* Because the Parthians ruled over an area that was much larger then the Egyptian peninsula, the Romans called it ""the land of the Parthians"", which sounds more familiar.

* The Parthians were, in essence, the same people who controlled the Persian empire at the time, and the Egyptians shared some of the same languages.",0
"So, just a heads up, this is a post I will try to make. If you don't want to read it, that's fine. This is the kind of post you just want to skip. 

I am going to start a new /r/askhistorians sub for this question: /r/AskEgypt. It will have the exact same rules and rules will be the same, but it will also be a place for historians to ask questions to historians about their field. 

I will make it up as I go. But here's what I have so far:

I am going to ask a question about the Roman Empire in Egypt. In a nutshell, I am going to ask:

**Why did the Romans in Egypt look different from the Romans elsewhere?**

I want to ask about the Roman Empire, but I want to know why the Romans in Egypt looked different. I want to know why they wore different clothes, what their diets were, how they lived etc.

I want to see if there is some source I can use. I will do this mostly by asking questions and getting answers from people who are knowledgeable about the Roman Empire in Egypt. I want to see if anyone has a great answer, but I also want to see if anyone has a great answer along the lines of ""why don't we wear suits and ties to Egypt? Why don't we go to Egypt? Why don't we wear suits and ties when we go?"" I want to hear the answer, but also, I want to know why it was like that.  

I am not really looking for a direct answer, but more so, I look for the answer which makes sense to me. I am a historian, and I know that it's important to take the time to understand the sources. 

Let me know if you have any questions.",0
"I'm sorry to be so far off topic from what you're asking, but you're asking about Roman Egypt in general, not just about the Roman Empire in Egypt. I have no idea what you're talking about.",0
"Sorry about the delay, but I'm going to have to get back to you on this. I just wanted to say that most of the information I've received on the first time period comes from a book named *Rome: Making it in the Empire of the Mediterranean* by Donald J. M. Williams (2003). There are a few other sources that are good, but I've only studied it as a source book for other books I plan on writing.

Also, I'll be sure to let you know if I ever come across any additional information on the second time period.",0
"Well, the short answer is ""we don't know"".

There's a lot of speculation about the way the Egyptians viewed their own past, and there's not really a lot of information about what they did in a day-to-day basis. 

However, there's some evidence that they had some kind of form of ""civilizing"" process. The [Museum of Egyptian Archaeology in Cairo](http://www.mosaic-museum.org/en/mosaic_catalogue/photos/j/j.htm) has some photos of what the Egyptians were doing in the 1st century BC. 

As you can see, they were probably still doing some kind of basic ritual daily life activities, like cleaning the hearths, building houses, using pots and pans, and a lot of them probably were still living in the desert, but they were also using the river for irrigation.

In fact, one of the most remarkable aspects of the Egyptian archaeological record is the lack of any evidence of how much they were busy building. There's some evidence that they did make some sort of effort to build temples, but there's lots of evidence that they were building houses, temples and settlements all the time.

They also had a lot of problems with disease, and probably a lot of the people who stayed in the desert area probably died at some point, but we don't know what the cause of their death might have been.

So there might have been a lot of people who were not working, and a lot of people who were working, but it looks like they were doing both. It's possible that people who were working were mostly farmers and craftsmen, and those who were working were mainly craftsmen and craftsmen. And so on.

It's also possible that the pharaohs were often just a figurehead, and that the people actually running the show were actually more important. If you go back to the reign of Tutankhamun, it seems like the Egyptians pretty much completely abandoned the idea of a pharaoh, and so you wouldn't really expect them to have anything to do with building temples.",0
"Well, they were mostly of European/Mediterranean racial background, with an African and European mixed background. 

*They* were the ones to conquer Egypt, and they were the ones who made it the dominant state in the region. So, in the short term (for the Roman Empire), the Egyptians were the only people/people of an African, European or Mediterranean background in charge of the place. It was the first state in the region to have a mixed racial background, and it was the first state to integrate the two groups into one. 

*They* were the first people to integrate the two groups into one, and to make one of them the dominant state - the first time a mixed state has existed. 

They were the ones who made the first conquests in the region, and the ones to make the first conquests in their own race - a mixture of one race with another. 

So, the Egyptians who conquered Egypt were the first people to look like the Romans of today - the first inter-racial conquerors, and as such they are the first people we know of to be considered ""Roman"". 

So, the Egyptians were the first people to look like the Romans today, but *and only* the first to look like the Romans today.",0

"They never really have to fight a war. A war is when a federation ship gets destroyed and we have seen only two federation ships (not to mention all the other species they're dealing with) and the Klingons and Romulans have just about destroyed every federation ship they encountered. That means there's nothing to fight and a war just means one ship gets destroyed, nothing else.",0
"It's a combination of many things.  In the first place, the Borg are an unstoppable force that can assimilate anything on their ""kill-list"" and are also more than a match for any Starfleet ship, even the one with the ""big guns.""  In the second place, the Borg are an unstoppable force that can also assimilate any planet they encounter.  

There's also the fact that if anyone on the Enterprise is a warrior, it's the crew of the Enterprise.  They've been through the equivalent of running off a cliff with a shotgun.  But that's not the best way to describe it.  The best way to describe it is that Starfleet is a group of people, who all have a common goal.  The common goal is to survive.  So when the Borg are at your door, they're going to kill you, and they can kill you in a very fast manner.  A lot of people on the Enterprise are going to die, but to them, it's just another day.  Sure, you want to give it time, but when the Borg are at your door, you're going to die.  So when the Borg are at your door, you're going to fight.",0
"I think most Trek viewers want to see space battles. The battle is the best thing about Star Trek - it's what the story is really about. There's an inherent flaw in all those battles we see, though. Trek fans want to see ships fly through the air, or fly through space, or shoot down missiles and lasers... but those are all possible. But they're also all unrealistic.

The Borg aren't going to come out of the blue one day. They're going to have a plan (like the Enterprise) by the time the Enterprise is halfway through the Delta Quadrant. They're not going to come out of the blue and blow up all the planets and space stations in the Delta Quadrant. They're not going to come out of the blue and send a single cube through an interphasic rift.

The closest we get to a battle is in the episode where they're caught in a warp bubble and have to fight to get out. But even in that case, the Enterprise is going to be out of position by the time the ship is out, and then they're going to have to fight it out in the nebula. Which is still going to take the Enterprise a good deal of time.

So, all these ships, it's not like they're going to fly through space, shoot lasers and missiles and lasers, and blow up planets.

The closest we get to battles in Trek is when the Enterprise has to fight the Dominion in DS9. The Dominion have a plan, and they have weapons that can destroy ships in a matter of seconds. They're also trying to take over a planet. So, the Enterprise has to fight it out there. But the Dominion also have other things they're looking for, like the wormhole. So, the battle doesn't just have to be over the planet.",0
"A few things. First, if the Federation were to launch a suicide mission in an attempt to destroy a planet, it would be a suicide mission. Second, the Dominion's goal is the total annihilation of the Federation. 

If the Federation were to send a full fleet of ships to engage the Dominion on a suicide mission, it wouldn't accomplish anything. The only way they could accomplish anything would be to destroy more ships and ships than necessary.",0
"I think what you're really asking is, ""would the Borg ever stop if the Enterprise tried to invade?"" Well no, they wouldn't.

First of all, the Borg are a species that is completely committed to assimilating all of their worlds and then wiping out the human species. In other words, if they had to fight the Enterprise, they'd just assimilate everyone on board.

Secondly, the Borg are not a race of tactical geniuses. They *are* an army of biological and technological soldiers, and they will not give up until the battle is over.

And thirdly, the Borg are *not* a race of religious pacifists. They have no qualms with taking human lives for the greater good, especially with so many of them.

So, no, they wouldn't do it.",0
"I think you're looking for a ""battle"" that involves all ships in full combat readiness. A battle is more of a ""fight"" to the death. What we see is a fight to the death, when you want to see a battle.",0
"As we've seen, the Federation is not afraid to engage in a fight, and even goes as far to engage in an offensive war when necessary. If they were not afraid to engage in a fight, we would not have seen a war. The Federation is not afraid of an offensive war, as they are capable of engaging in one.

It's not a matter of planning or strategy, but a matter of courage and willingness. The Federation is no different than any other species when it comes to the concept of fighting a war.",0

It's okay for a relationship to focus on the college life, but you're not in college anymore. Just because you're not in college anymore doesn't mean you're not there for your friends.

You're not an asshole, at all. What you're doing is a perfectly reasonable request. She should have been willing to make plans with you. However she refused your request, you're the asshole. 

> I'm not asking for a friendship, I'm asking for a friend. I feel like that's the only way I will be able to talk to her.

Again, you're not an asshole, you're just an adult. You can be a friend. 

I think the best thing for both of you is to go to dinner, preferably with some of her friends. You could ask her if she wants to go with you (and apologize for the other night if you really need to). Then you can go to a bar together or something.

Also I'm going to give you two cents here about the ""you can't have friends"" thing. In my personal experience, if a young person has never had a friend, they're really not allowed to make friends until they're at least in high school. And even then, they often have a hard time making friends. It really depends on the young person and their personal circumstances. I mean, you're young, you're free to make friends. But the fact of the matter is, it's not gonna happen if you don't actively make your own.",0

">A ""deep shift"" in Indonesian society has seen the country become the world's fifth most populous democracy in the past decade, according to a new report.

>The report was compiled by the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs think-tank, which has been analysing statistics on democracy and human development.

>The report showed that Indonesia is the only country to have experienced a ""deep shift"" in its democracy over the past decade. That's a measure of a country either being a ""democracy plus"" - it retains some elements of its dictatorship, but has ""better freedom to select its leaders"" - or a ""democracy minus"" - it has been swept by mass protests, but the country has been ""more free to select its leaders"".

>In Indonesia, the report said, ""democracy plus"" has been the dominant trend since 2007. It also said that Indonesia has been experiencing a ""democratisation"" of its political system, with the number of parties and number of political parties in parliament rising by 50 per cent in just four years.

>""The political environment is increasingly characterised by the pluralistic and dynamic political culture of Indonesia, where parties and politics are increasingly open to non-traditional political actors and political organisations. This can only be good for the country,"" the report said.",0
"# The story of Indonesia

# Indonesian history

Indonesia has the second largest population in the world (9.4 million) and the second largest population (1.4 billion) in the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesia has an official language and three official script systems: Indonesian, Bahasa Indonesia and Malay.

The country's population is diverse; half of Indonesia's population is Muslim, while the other half is Buddhist. Religion is a core aspect of Indonesian life, with almost two thirds of the population belonging to a single community.

# Indonesian political system

Indonesian politics are governed by a parliamentary system and a presidential system. The House of Representatives (Hindustan Indonesia) is the largest political body of the country, with members that are elected by the people. There is a House of Representatives and a Senate in Indonesia, with two chambers. The House of Representatives determines the government's policies. The upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, decides on laws and regulations.

The president (President of the Republic) is elected by the parliament. However, the president is not the head of state, so the prime minister (Prime Minister of the Republic) is the head of state.

# Indonesian Constitution

The Indonesian Constitution (Likon Indonesia) is set up along with a Parliamentary system with a presidential system. The Indonesian constitution was ratified in 1952.

The Constitution states that the President can be elected by the people, but requires a 2/3 majority to be elected. The constitution lists the President, Parliament, Council of State and Senate as the three branches of government.

# Indonesian language

The Indonesian language is the national language, and is the second-most widely spoken language in the world. Most of Indonesia's population speaks the English language.

# Indonesian currency

The Indonesian Rupiah is the official currency of Indonesia. It is based on the rupiah's symbol, the rupiah. Other currencies, such as the Philippine peso, use the rupiah as their symbol.

# Indonesian religion

Indonesia is the only country in Southeast Asia where Islam is the dominant religion, with about 90% of the population being Muslim.

# Indonesian military

The Indonesian Navy (Tentara Nasional Indonesia) is the largest military in the world, with an operational strength of about 200,000.

# Indonesian Civil War

The Indonesian Civil War (Rakyat Darak, Rakyat Darusak) is one of the longest in the world, lasting from 1965 to 1998. The Indonesian Civil War was sparked by the Indonesian government's refusal to hand over power to the then president Sukarno after a general election. The Indonesian government held general elections in 1975, and won the election.

The conflict lasted for 28 years. It was a popular cause among the middle class in the nation. The conflict was officially ended by an agreement between the government and the political opposition in 1992.

# History

The population of Indonesia is mostly Hindu, and the religion has been the driving force behind the country's society for the last 150 years. Since its foundation, the country has been ruled by the military, and has been seen as a bastion of stability as the world was in the shadow of the Cold War.

The country was also the last to adopt democracy, in 1947.

# Economic importance

The economic importance of Indonesia is the sixth-largest economy in the world. It is also the second-largest exporter in the world.",0

"A lot of it is very quotable, which was certainly the case on the original album. One way in which the full-length is a lot more consistent is in terms of the pacing. There are longer songs here, but they all follow the same basic format - they start with a nice quiet melody, then build up to a loud chorus or loud rock, and then quiet on a long, drawn-out solo. The only real exception is [The Good Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvBQp2kOwY), and that's probably a good example of the album at its most ""in-your-face"", although it's not nearly as good of an example as I hear it described as.",0

I also don't care about the social aspect of it. I don't enjoy the social aspect of it. It's not like I want to go home and smoke weed all night. I'd rather have a good day at work.



I only like molly when I'm on a weekend and have time to do it. I also don't like the comedowns either so I usually don't do it on a work night when I'm on the grind.



I don't like the headspace you get from it. It's got a lot of headspace. You feel tired, like you just had a big night out. It'll take you a while to adjust to the headspace. I like my comedowns longer. I prefer to do it when I've had a bit to drink. 



Molly can be a very long lasting drug. I can't really say I like molly long term once I've used it. I do, however, prefer it long term over any other drugs that I do. I prefer MDMA to lsd or mushrooms for all my other drugs, however. 



When I do Molly I really like to get high but I definitely don't like to roll. I find it hard to roll on MDMA I find it hard to get fucked up on MDMA. I don't like to take MDMA as to not get fucked up on MDMA I can't get fucked up on MDMA. I do like the social aspect of the drug it's great when I'm tripping on it. I don't like the comedowns of MDMA I do like the comedowns of it being a more long lasting drug. I can't really say I like molly long term it's not my thing.",0

"> I'm writing a book about the current state of the Left, so I'm doing a series of interviews with folks from the Left and Right, as well as academics, activists, and thinkers.

> What is your view of the future of the Left? Can it go left?

> For the Left, the answer is of course yes. For the Right, it's more complicated.

> The Left and Right are not even two separate political tendencies, but in many cases they are indistinguishable.

> Both Right-wingers and Left-wingers have different concerns, and different concerns translate into different policy proposals.

> One way to think about these differences is by asking: do you think the Left has ""too much freedom,"" and the Right has ""too much control""? I would argue that the answer to this question is yes.

> There is a huge difference between saying the Left needs to ""control"" some things and saying the Left needs to ""control"" everything.

> One of the major problems the Left has is that it has a lot of ideas about what it needs to control, and it fails to get those ideas across. This is what the Right does better.

> However, the Left also has a lot of ideas about what it needs to control. At its best, the Left has an idea about what it needs to control, and it knows how to control that idea with a little bit of discipline and a lot of organization.

> The problem is that too much of either ""the Left"" or ""the Right"" is either too much too little, and it's counterproductive to try to control all of either. The left has a lot of ideas about what it needs to control, but it needs to organize its ideas about what it needs to control, and the Right will never let the Left organize its ideas about what it needs to control.

> For the Left and the Right, it's better to keep the discussion focused on just what needs to be controlled.

> You can go on and on about how the Left needs to control some things and not others, but that's not really helpful.

> When you hear the Right say ""You're trying to control people's lives!"", the Right is often responding to the Left's ""You're trying to control people's minds!"", and those are different things. It's better to focus on just what needs to be controlled.",0

"The answer to your question is very simple in the case of a stateless society. 

There is a government. You cannot get away with what you are doing if you are not a member of that government. You must pay taxes to it. 

Then you have a government with rules. It is the government that enforces the rules. It does not have the power to enforce its own rules, so the only people who enforce the rules are people who are not members of the government.

This situation is a perfect example of the capitalist system. It creates the rules, enforces the rules, and enforces its own rules on the people who are not members of it. It creates a class system that privileges the rich over the poor. It is a system where people are exploited by rich people. 

So, the answer to your question is simple: the state.",0

What do you mean by exploitation?,0
"I think it depends on the form of socialism you have. 

If you have communism then it's about how to distribute resources and decide how society will function. 

If you have socialism then it's about deciding how society functions and what the roles of the individual are. 

So it's really a combination of the two, and there are definitely things you can do to prevent people from exploiting each other.",0

"I think the idea that racism is ""dead"" is ridiculous. Racism is alive and well, and is alive and well in the minds of people living in the United States, both white and non-white. 

Racism exists to perpetuate itself, it's not something we can easily eradicate. I think the most important thing to recognize here is that racism is both an opinion and a behavior. 

If you are a man, you are probably more likely to be accepted over a woman. If you are a woman, you are more likely to be accepted over a man. If you are black and rich, you are more likely to be accepted over a white person of other races. If you are black and poor, you are more likely to be accepted over other races. 

Racism is a *behavior*. It is a feeling. It is a belief. It is a way of looking at the world. It is a reason for being. 

Racism is not being ""born"" anymore than it is being ""born"" to be a man, or born to be a woman. It is something you grow up with, and your attitudes are created by your environment. 

The fact that we live in a world where women are treated as second-class citizens is a huge part of why racism is alive and well, and why it is not ""dead"". When people see a black man and a white woman, they will more likely automatically assume that the man is more likely to be the one who is an abuser. This is not to say that there is no sexism in the world, but I think it is important to note that racism is alive and well, and there are many people who are racist because of their own experiences, not because of how people treat them (or because they were born that way).",0
"Well, it's in a lot of places where it's used as a way to shut down discussion, but maybe it's not dead in America.

1. You didn't put the door up on the correct position. For example, if the door is on the third shelf of the fridge, a fridge may be left open.

2. You're opening the door too quickly. This is most likely an issue with your door mechanism and door frame, but it can happen too.

3. You opened the door too slow. For example, if the door handle is just out of reach, closing the door too slowly. Even if the door handle is easy to reach, you may be close to the door frame before the door closes.",0

There are probably a lot of things in your life that would be easier to deal with in the relationships you're currently in.  Instead of staying in the relationship and trying to fix it, you should start moving on.  

If the only thing holding you back from leaving her is financial trouble, then you should work on that first.  Once that's solved, you can get yourself back out there and do whatever it is you want to do.

It's up to you, it's not fair to force someone to choose between you and their family. 

If you think she is ready to be with you then let her go. But let her make the decision for herself, you should have no say nor influence in that decision. If she chooses to be with her family then it's you and her that will be the ones ending things.

I kind of like to be the cause of her problems. I think it's fun for me to be the cause of her problems. I think it's fun for me to cause her problems.

I think you should just be supportive of her and be there for her when she's having a bad time, and when she's having a good time. If she's having a good time, you can try to help her out, but if she's having a bad time you can try to tell her to get over it and forget about it.",0

* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning",0
"There is no one right ""metric"" that can be used to measure ML performance.

It can be measured in many ways, but there is no single one metric that can be used to compare different ML algorithms.

The metric that will be relevant is one that is most applicable to the problem.  

One of the most important ML metrics is the number of label samples that satisfy a given validation set.  If you are measuring performance of the algorithm in classifying labels, there's no metric that is applicable.

So, to answer your question, there are plenty of metrics that can be used to measure ML performance, but they will vary in usefulness across different problems.",0
"I think the best way to measure ML performance is to try to quantify the impact ML has on your business (e.g. how much money we save if my marketing team can do things like auto-generated emails, or how much money we save from a more complete product catalog, or how much money we saved by getting rid of a useless feature, etc.).

Then measure how well your business does using these metrics (e.g. how many people go to the website, how many of the users sign up, how many of the users pay, etc.).

For more specific stuff, I think that you can try to measure what the average price of a product is using the algorithm, and then you can try to guess the price by measuring the average price of the product. If you can guess the price correctly, you can try to measure how much money the average customer spends on the product.

If all your metrics are measured correctly, you can try to measure what the average quality of customer service is. If you measure the quality of the product, you can guess the price, but this is difficult to do, as you can't know the price the customer will pay.",0
"Usually ML is measured by how long it takes to train the algorithm for a given problem. I.e. for a fixed amount of data the algorithm takes, it'll take at most a given amount of time to train it. If someone is going to measure the performance of a system/algorithm, I think their metric or metric is the time it takes to train that system/algorithm.

Another metric is how good it is at finding relevant features. For example, if people use a classifier to classify images of cats, they'll measure the accuracy by how fast it finds the correct classification.",0
"A good way to measure the performance of any ML algorithm is to compare its performance to a benchmark algorithm that is at the same level as your algorithm. If your algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithm, it is better than your algorithm.

A good benchmark algorithm is typically the benchmark for another ML algorithm. So if your algorithm does better than a benchmark algorithm, it's better than your algorithm.

I recommend picking a benchmark algorithm that is at the same level as your algorithm.",0

Basically the goal is to create machines that would be so powerful and flexible that they would be able to solve all problems that are currently known to be problems to the human mind.

The human mind is able to solve a problem by creating a better solution.  So what is needed is the ability to create a better solution.

I can also see this being super useful in VR. You could have a VR headset that you connect to a laptop, the laptop could be connected to the VR headset and it could be hooked up to the laptop again.

If you want to know more about this kind of thing, I'd suggest listening to the podcast ""I Am That Thing"". I enjoy it because it's mostly just talking, with a little bit of a scientific/spiritual tone and some helpful advice. Plus, it's well worth the $5/month if you're interested. 

Also, you probably know all about this, but meditation is not the same thing as meditation retreats. They're a lot of work, and don't really do anything to actually ""get you out of your body"". It's more like just a very safe and comforting way of taking control of your own life. 

Best of luck to you!",0
"""I am the Universe, I am everything. I am the mind, I am the experience. I am the soul, I am the consciousness. I am the body, I am the life. I am the spirit, I am the Universe. I am the being, I am the spirit. I am your soul, I am the universe."" - Alan Watts",0
"This is a hard one but I think I can maybe help you.

If you really want to get out of bed, you have to wake up to your true nature. If you are not awakened, you have to put yourself in a position of being awakened.

If you are not awake you are not going to do anything about this. It's a process. You just have to do the work, so to speak.

You can help yourself out by following the path of mindfulness, being mindful of your feelings, your moods, the world around you. By doing that you can bring awareness to your own feelings and emotions, which will give you a chance to take a break from it and go into a deeper state of awareness. This will give you clarity to make sure that you are doing the right things at the right time and not using the wrong methods.

If you're not willing to put in the work you can always just keep surfing and doing things that you don't care about. You will never change. 

Meditation helps because it helps you to be in the present and take a break from the past, the future, and all things that are not experiencing the present moment.

I do believe in an afterlife. I don't believe in a heaven and a hell, I believe in this reality. And in this reality death is just another part of the journey. You can make it last as long as you want or you can make it last as short as you want. The choice is up to you.",0
"There are no problems.  The only way we can truly ""get out of bed"" is to accept ourselves for who we are.  We can't change that.  We can accept that we have a problem and let it be.  Then we can make a decision.  We can choose to either let this continue to drag us out of body, or we can choose to change it.  

If you really want to quit meditation, you will.  You will give up.  You will be a problem.  You will be dragging yourself out of bed.  You will be trying to change who you are.  You will be dragging yourself out of your body.  You will be attempting to change the problem.  If you want to change the problem, you must stop making the problem.

Change the problem.  Accept the problem.  Let it be.  Let it be.",0
"I can relate. I get the same feeling from meditating/working on my practice. I have no idea how to deal with it, and I'm pretty sure it isn't something I can fix myself.

Sometimes it feels like it's a good thing to be sad. It means that your heart is still strong and you can still feel empathy towards others. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like that's not what's best for the heart. You're definitely not completely alone in this though. The best thing you can do is to just do what you can to work through your feelings. Don't worry about what you should do. Just do what feels right. For me, it's usually meditating in which I can let my thoughts pass me by, and let my breath fill me up completely. It's a great feeling. And the feeling you're getting is probably the same feeling you get when you meditate. You're probably just running from your heart to your mind, which you have no control over. Just accept that feeling and let it pass. Or accept that feeling and let it pass through you. It's all a matter of perspective.",0
"No, this is not a good way to do it.  You have to ask yourself, ""What is this?"" (The process of asking is the best you can do).  You also have to ask yourself, ""What is it I am doing when it happens?""  It really is a process of asking yourself.  You have to be willing to ask that question, and asking it is an act of courage. (And yes, I use the word courage, I don't mean to sound too ""Christian"" or ""religious"" like).  Ask yourself what is your feeling right now.  What is your problem that you feel like you need to solve?  If you can't answer that, then you've got to take a step back.

I think you have to make a choice.  Do you want to be strong and be able to deal with it, or do you want to just be a mess?  There is no good choice.  It's a question of what you want to be, not one of what you *want to be*.  What is the strength that you want to have?

I think you either want to be strong of being able to deal with it, or you want to just be an idiot that can't deal with it.  You want to be able to deal with it without knowing exactly what it is you are dealing with.  You can't deal with it if you don't even know what it is that you are dealing with.

You should ask yourself why you want to deal with it.  What is it that you *want* to do?  What is *it* that you *want* to do?

I used to want to be able to deal with it.  I wanted to be able to just cry, because that's the easiest way to deal with it.  I was very emotionally vulnerable, and it didn't seem like I could handle it.  I was so emotionally vulnerable, and when I cried, I felt it and it felt good, but I was scared to cry.

I changed my mind.  Now I want to be as strong as I can be.  Yes, we all want to be strong.  But this is *your* strength.  It's just something that you can handle.

Do you want to be strong?  What is it that you want to do?  What is the strength that you want to have?",0
"There is always a part of you that wants to get out of bed. It's part of your desire. Meditation can help you focus on the desire, and eventually you will get it out of your head. You'll wake up and everything will be fine. Don't think that meditation has to be a ""get out of bed"" sort of thing. It's a part of your life.",0
It may be that you need to be more aware of what is causing you to feel that way.,0
"I have had this problem before. It is hard to describe. It's a sensation of being stuck in a deep dark place. It is often accompanied by a feeling of pain, and often times a strong urge to move away from that place, but the best way to describe it is I think it's a feeling of being stuck in a whirlpool of emotions and thoughts and sensations that is too much for me to handle, but I am not sure how to move out of it.",0

>It is a tool for the government to wage perpetual wars, but it is a tool of the people. It is not the government's tool.

You're right. It's not a tool of the people, but it's not entirely without their influence. 

>The government can control the military, but it cannot control it's own people. It controls the people, but it does not control the people.

This only means that the government is not able to control the people, but the people of the people can control the government's actions. I mean, I get the idea that the US government can't control the people, but I don't understand why the US government is in control of the people. 

>The military is a tool for the government to wage perpetual wars.

Again, this is not true. The military is not a tool for the government to wage perpetual wars. Military intervention is something the government does, however. 

>It is not the government's tool.

Yes, it is. 

>The people don't have to pay taxes because the people don't like paying taxes.

Well. That's not true. If a man is paid in gold and silver, and that man puts that gold and silver in his pocket, that man is paying in ""taxes"" of some sort, and the man who is paying in taxes also has a coin, and that man's coin has a face value of five dollars, so the man who is paying in taxes has something of value, and the man who is paying in taxes has nothing of value. 

>The military is a tool for the government to wage perpetual wars.

I'm sorry, but this is not the case. The US government does not wage perpetual wars and the Military does not wage perpetual wars. The military does not wage perpetual wars because the people want perpetual wars.",0

"If you do anything interesting enough, you'll get noticed. It's not rocket science.

If you do something interesting enough, you'll get noticed in any meaningful way. As far as jobs go, there are a plethora of ways to get one. Some people get a degree, some people start a company, some people start a small business and/or join an industry. Most people don't have to work for money, and those that do have to get lucky on many occasions.

If you want something that pays well, there are a variety of ways to do it. Start a company online, become an online entrepreneur, become a professional freelancer.

If you want something that will pay well, you need to start an online business. There are lots of ways to do this. Some people use a company that is too big, some people use a company that is just starting to operate, some people just go through the hiring process and get hired by a company that has already gotten a lot of people.

If you want something that pays well, you have to be a professional, you need to be in the top 10% of your profession.

Another great thing is that if you're a young person, you can get a student job in a lot of different sectors, like teaching or teaching to young people, or anything that's teaching or teaching to people with no or little knowledge on how things work. I got a job at a local children's home, and I'm planning to stay there until I can return to the UK, which is going to be some time.

I'm also involved in the youth wing of our national youth club. We're a big charity that works with young people, and the people who run it are great. It's a great thing to be involved in, and I'm glad I did it.

I also do a lot of stuff with kids on a volunteer basis. I help out at their school, and we do a lot of fun projects that can usually be done by 10 or 12 year old kids. I like it a lot, because I have a lot of fun with them. It's great.

It's actually hard to find a job, because you need experience, and I've only had a couple of jobs. But I've been successful at getting to know some really good people, and I'm really enjoying the community work I've been doing.

I think if you don't have experience, it's good to look for a lot of different jobs, and then find a job that you like. I had a lot of help from people who worked with me, and helped me find a job to do, and it really helped me. Also, it's really good to have a good network of people, so that you can help out wherever you go.

Also, if you're looking for a job, get the fuck out of university and look for a job. It's a great way to get experience, and you can help out with a lot of different things that can be useful later on.

It was actually in my sister's house. We were at my sister's house because my husband's parents had to stay with us for awhile. My husband, my sister, and her friend were having dinner at the restaurant in the kitchen, waiting for us to finish eating. About 20 minutes after they started eating, someone knocked on the door.

My husband, who was in the bathroom, thought it was my husband. My sister, who was eating at the table, thought it was my sister. The friend, who was eating at the table, thought it was her friend. I thought it was our friend who was eating at the table.

After about 20 minutes, we started to wonder if it was actually someone in our house. Not that we didn't believe it was the paranormal, it was just that the door was so quiet we just assumed it was the guy who was knocking on the door.

So I opened the door. It was the guy that knocked on the door. My husband, who was in the bathroom, thought it was my husband. My sister, who was eating at the table, thought it was my sister. The friend, who was eating at the table, thought it was her friend. I thought it was our friend who was eating at the table.

I told him about this and he said that he never heard the knocking. He said it was probably the washing machine. At first I asked him if he was sure. He said he was. I asked him about the knocking, and he said he heard it. I asked him if he heard it loud enough to hear it in the house, and he said he did. So I asked him if he heard the knocking in the kitchen, and he said he did too. 

So we both heard it.",0

"I'm glad you asked.
The story of ""to speak"" goes like this:

When you were a boy, you learned to speak, and with the most charming voice you could muster. You sang the ""most beautiful songs"" and the most beautiful songs, and you would sing them all night long. Your father and mother would praise you for the songs you sang and the songs you loved. You would be the most beloved son in the entire town.

But then you grew old and you grew old, and you grew old to the point of not speaking. But you are still singing them all night long, and you are still singing them all day long.

You still love the songs, and you still love the song.

So do you speak or do you die?",0
"'To speak' is an old English verb that has many different meanings. The most common meaning is to speak, and the second most common meaning is to address someone. It can also be translated into the German ""auch"" which means basically to speak. 

The literal meaning of ""to speak"" is ""to address"" and the phrase ""to address"" refers to the word ""to speak"". This is why the second most common meaning of this word is used to mean ""to address"".

The third most common meaning is ""to speak"" and refers to the verb ""to speak"". The same meaning could also be applied to the verb ""to speak"", but that would make more sense.",0
"I'll start a new thread, so I can't be bothered to look it up but it isn't spelled *sarcasm.",0
"It's a derivative of the verb *hasta*, meaning ""to come"".  Its etymology is obscure, though, but it appears to have been used in the context of ""to speak"" as early as the 16th century.

It sounds like a pretty strong word to derive from the verb's meaning, to come to a conclusion, or to declare one's case.  

I can see a parallel in English ""speak,"" ""speak to"", ""speak to the man"", ""speak to the horse,"" etc.

If you have an idea for a better English word for it, that'd be fantastic.",0

It's the realization that there is a part in the universe that is ""me"" and that I am a piece of that whole. It's the realization that I am part of the universe, in that the universe is part of me, and that I am not the universe.

"Calories are calories. Their source is irrelevant (for all intents and purposes), whether from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins.

It is entirely possible to lose weight eating only Twinkies if you keep the total caloric intake (what you eat) lower than the calories you burn. This has literally been done by a nutrition professor some years ago. It's not particularly healthy as Twinkies don't contain the nutrients for a healthy diet, but you can lose weight if your calories in < calories out.",1
"To get the proper definition of Calorie it is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1gram of water by 1 degree Celsius or 1 Kelvin. So something with higher calories means it has more ""energy stored within"".

Different food stuffs have different caloric values; Fats contain the most calories (1 gram of fat is like 9kcal or so) and then there's Alcohol (which is 7kcal per gram) then it's Proteins, Carbohydrates, Sugar Alcohols (like artificial sweeteners such as Sorbitol, Mannitol etc) and then there's Fibre which is like 2kcal per gram.

We all need a healthy balance of all of the things in the food pyramid to survive. Fats are broken down into Fatty Acids (which are used for important things such as making the cell membranes in our cells), Proteins are broken down into Amino Acids (important for making proteins so that we can repair and create things within the body like enzymes or DNA) and Carbohydrates/Sugars are broken down into even smaller sugars like Glucose (this is what's used as fuel, to make it super simple). If you want to obtain quick energy in the body you eat sugars, if you want semi-quick to medium energy release you eat carbs, if you want a slow energy release then eat fats. Eating fatty things will just end up being stored into the body under normal conditions and are notoriously difficult to remove since the body goes after the easy fuels first rather that what's stored inside of us.

Glucose can flow freely in the blood, be stored in the Liver and muscles as Glycogen (to be used quickly later) or converted into fats to be used for long term storage and slow release. If you don't take in glucose in your body then it will try to find the energy by using biochemical reactions and use other sources such as fats and even proteins (that's why muscles waste away if you end up starving yourself for too long). Each type of food is broken down into something that is very useful in the body, if you don't eat it then your body will just end up having problems which can affect you both in the short term and in the long term if left untreated.",1

I got beat a few times, I even called the hint hotline, and the guy told me that he didn’t think it would be possible to beat the boss (a golem), and I was crushed. It was my only save that I had, and I was hours upon hours in. I was thirteen, and all of that time was going to be wasted. I wasn’t going to give up on this, and I thought about a  slow slow process of how I could do this. I beat that boss. It took me three hours of delicate timing, last minute heals, potions, and magic. I had to come down to less than 25hp multiple times to do this, it was risky as all hell. One single battle, not reloads, took me that amount of time. Victory was mine.

"Here is my own story. My sisters used to get paid to clean my dad's workplace every weak. It was a decent sized building. Definitely not giant, but not too small either. One day, I decided to tag along and help out because I didn't want to be left home alone. I had been put in charge of the outside jobs. Even though it was broad daylight I'd been freaking myself out the entire time, jumping at every little noise in the background as if something bad was about to happen. My dad's work building was located in a fairly sketchy neighborhood so being outside alone made me nervous. I was picking up cigarettes butts and trash when I heard, ""Hey, come here!"" In a deep male voice. I ignored it. It made me anxious, but every little noise out there was making me anxious so I thought I was being rediculous and simply wrote it off, not allowing myself to pause the task at hand in order to glance around and find the source of the noise when (or so I thought) the words obviously weren't intended for me. That's when I heard ""Come here!"" again in a clear, male voice. The speaker had no accent and clearly had been speaking English for a long time. This time I turned around. My heart skipped a beat when I saw a white pickup truck slowing down at the entrance to the parking lot. I was still wondering if maybe he just wanted to ask me about my father's place of work, or one of the other businesses renting out a part of the same building, or if he wasn't even pulling in at all. Nevertheless, the pickup truck actually did pull into the parking lot and began driving up to me. I caught a vague glimpse of the man in the car. I could not make out any distinguishing features, but I did see that his eyes were directly set on me. I was gripped by an intense wave of fear and darted up a few steps and back inside the building to retrieve one of my sisters. She immediately locked the doors once I told her what happened. She went to grab her phone in order to call our dad when she looked out the clear glass doors again and saw that The man's truck was parked parallel to the building, right in front of the doors we were standing behind and the man was no longer in his car. It was extremely odd that he didn't park in a proper parking spot. He simply parked right in the middle of the parking lot right in front of our building as if he needed to get out in a rush. Over the phone our father told us to lock all the doors, stay inside, and keep cleaning like usual but to stay vigilant. We did just that. A few minutes later, while I was cleaning the glass doors from the inside, I saw my dad and a one of his friends (both large, intimidating grown men) pulling up into the parking lot and getting out to the confront the the dude who had called out to me. The man was now in his car at this point. I called to my sisters and we observed them talk to the guy. My dad and his friend came up to the door while the guy drove away. We let them in, thinking the situation was resolved. The first thing my dad said was, ""Are you sure that was the car?"" So I, of course, said yes with absolute certainty. Seemingly a bit stunned, my dad said, ""That guy's Chinese. His accent made him extremely hard to understand."" This struck me as odd because I very clearly heard that man say, ""come here,"" twice with no accent. My dad went on to say that he watched the guy come out of the ""massage parlor"" next door that we're fairly sure is a prostitution ring for numerous reasons. The man was apparently trying to explain why he went in and came out of the building so fast. According to my dad, the man seemed suspiciously anxious. If there was nothing sketchy going on the man would have had no reason to be nervous. My older sister asked if I was about to be human trafficked or something. My dad and his friend said that was what was most likely going on and that the man might have been faking his accent to seem less suspicious and help get out of the situation. We had to talk to the cops and give a statement. The cop that came to take our statement sat outside of the building in his car while we finished cleaning to make sure we were safe. Later on that day my father showed me the security footage from the camera outside of his work building showing what happened. When the man got out of his truck he looked around The front of the building, walking back and forth, perhaps looking for other unsuspecting young girls, (although that's just an assumption on my part) before he went into that ""massage parlor."" Although I am not actually sure what that man's intentions were that day, or whether he was planning on harming me at all, the experience was still extremely scary and continues to make me wonder what could have happened.",1
"That’s not how sex trafficking works and it’s super problematic to claim you were “almost trafficked”. Stories like this go viral all the time and police always say that it wasn’t sex trafficking. 

Traffickers target young, poor girls. They overwhelmingly target brown and black girls. They target runaways, kids in foster homes, and homeless children. 

They don’t snag kids or women out of parking lots and there is an abundance of actual data to back this up.",1

"OK, I'll bite...

It was back on Thursday Sept 16th of 1999.  Back then, I was in my early 30's, I'm old now in my 50's...

On Sunday Sept 20th I was moving 8 hours away to a different state to begin a new job.

Some background is that I'd been having sex with Heather and Kristin for years to that point. They were roommates with each other.

I'd also been having sex with Candice too.

We were planning a going away party (not just for me, I hired both Heather and Kristin to work for me in the new state and they moved there shortly after I did).

I knew what I wanted, to have sex with Candice, Heather and Kristin.

I knew Heather and Kristin would be up for it, the question was whether Candice would want to join in.

There was only one way to find out and that was to ask her, so I did.  I was going to be moving in days so even if she was upset by my asking, it wasn't going to amount to much but I knew she wouldn't get upset. She might have said no, but we had a good relationship too (FWB with each other).

Candice agreed and on the afternoon of Thursday Sept 16th of 1999, the three of them and me had sex with each other at Heather and Kristin's house (they rented a small two bedroom, one bath, single car garage place).

The three of them were all different in major ways in terms of their bodies, looks, personalities etc. so it was beyond nice to be able to be with all 3 of them at the same time.

Candice had known of both Heather and Kristin for years and years but they weren't really close.  They had worked together years before, but Candice left the company we were at years before so she wasn't in their lives much the two years or so leading up to the end of summer of 1999.",1

It was really hard for me to make friends. It felt like nobody saw me and tried to pend a hand, which i both liked and disliked at the same time. it's hard to make such close bonds with people for the school to just shuffle everybody up the next year making me uncapable to barely see them all month(the school is big)
eventually though, i managed to slide into a group of people who took me from my hole to be friends without despite me looking weird at first.

Honestly, i love them for that.",1

" Excerpt from the article, emphasis mine:

> **White people generally do not share the same history and culture**, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color.

I thought it was noteworthy that the Associated Press's implied position here is that white people have more diverse histories and cultures than black (I mean, Black) people. Has some interesting implications re: how to increase *diversity* in the workplace, for example.",1

Sometimes it brings people comfort to “headcanon” a character as having a certain gender identity or sexuality because they identify with a certain aspect of the character. This could be a reflection of that or the fact that they’re a fan of the character as well as a member of the community.,1

"It depends on the person. As a woman who used to be a teenage girl obviously, i just really dislike these generalization posts bc every individual is so different than the next.

As for general conversation tips, start off with the normal stuff like greetings (hey, how are you, hows your day, what are you up to) and then interests, so on.

Each time you talk, really listen, if you are truly interested in this person, you probably listen anyway. (By listen i mean... actively read bc its thru text lol). Relate to them. Find things to talk about that relate to her words or her story.

Some of us can talk for hours and will be glad if someone is actually there to listen. Others are shy, might like listening to you more. You have to find the balance. Maybe if she is shy and you talk a lot about yourself, ask her follow up questions. 

I probably have more tips but I cannot think off the top of my head",1
Hello! Would you like to destroy some evil today?,1
"Just say, ""hey, how are you today?"". And then just be you, without being a fucking creep. How often? well, I wouldn't say every day, but often enough. There's a balance between being interested and just being pushy",1
"Ask her a question about herself.  Not a boring question, but not a crazy one, either.",1
"A good starting point could be something related to how you got the number in the first place. Clearly a contextual thing, but y’know if you met this girl at your tennis club, tennis is a good starting point a for the conversation because it’s something you have in common. As for how often, if you’re just having a casual conversation, I’d honestly be inclined to match whatever her frequency is. If she’s texting you every hour responding to stuff your saying, then there’s nothing wrong with texting her several times a day. If she texts you once a week, I’d probably do so in similar time. Some folks will say that your only goal when texting a romantic interest (I’m assuming this is the case because you’re specifying gender), that your only goal should be to schedule a time to hang out and actually talk. As a younger guy myself, I recognize that a lot of people actually do use texting to hold meaningful conversations- you’ll just have to see if she’s interested in that.",1

Start with with something funny,1
"This happens too often... it is usually a man who says it to whomever(man or woman). Not that theyre being sexist, but generally are heated themselves and view emotion as a bad thing, thus the ""too emotional.""

It is either projection and they cant handle their emotions or they just assume someone is being emotional because of the subject matter.

For example, when talking about a sensitive or emotional topic, they will infer you are being too emotional despite your comment being unbiased or even biased with facts. Just not ""emotional.""

Frankly, I see nothing wrong with being emotional regardless. We are not robots. It's okay to care about things. Just becauss society acts like you cant doesnt mean you shouldnt, especially as a man. I think all men should be emotional when they talk lol",1
"Also, when someone says something calmly and someone who is obviously trying to be annoying or start drama says ""why are you mad 💀💀💀"" or ""why are you upset 🤡""

Like, I'm not. But the use of your emojis and tone of your comment is pretty condescending, which makes me pretty f*kn mad, tbh.",1
"Everh day on reddit.

"My mother's friend's husband (now divorced) who had spent over 30 years in prison.  
   
He didn't seem that dangerous he was just a bit of an asshole.",1
"Based on their mental state and physicality?

I'm a big guy.  I'm 6'2"" (188cm) and at the time was around 240 pounds (109kg).

I had to interact with a guy because of work.  He was a few inches taller and heavier built than I was.  He was wearing blue jeans that were shredded and hanging in tatters from the knees down, and he smelled like milk that had gone bad.  Hair was plastered in place.  Dirty shirt.

About once a minute he'd stop our conversation and play a few seconds of a song out loud on his phone.  Different song every time.  Would give his total attention to it.

Half the time he'd come back from that and talk about needing a ride somewhere.  The other half he'd just start telling stories.

Where'd he need a ride?  (I was working for a transportation company at the time by the way.)  A sporting goods store.  Why?  (I didn't ask him, but he told me anyway.)  A tent.  He wanted to go live in the woods.  He also wanted a big knife.  A sharp knife.

What stories did he tell?  

He said he loved his sister.  Then he started crying for a few seconds.

He said he had to stay in a place for a while and when he was there he threw a guy on the ground and he kicked him and he kicked him and he kicked him and he kicked him.

Now picture this.  In between every story and every song and every request he'd just stop moving or saying anything and just zone out for a few seconds.  Then start back up on doing or saying something else.

-----

The best way I can put it is that I'm not badass.  My life's put me in some interesting situations though.  I've been threatened with loaded guns.  I've trained with people that I knew could kill me and that were legit badasses.  I've been confronted by twitchy people at night in bad neighborhoods.

This guy set off warning signals in my head I've never experienced before, and I'd rather deal with any of those other situations again than have had to deal with him if he snapped.

I've run into bears, big cats, snakes, and sharks in the wild.  I've had to face guard dogs and roaming packs of dogs.  I'd much rather be around them than him as well, but that was more of what he reminded me of.  He felt like an animal that had gone wrong somehow.",1

My chickens are free range and I *bust ass* to protect them from predators, none of them has any interest in living in the surrounding wilderness.

My horse literally escaped her pasture one time and all she did was come up to the house and hang out.

There’s a reason barely any humans choose to live in true wilderness. Many of us sacrifice our time, happiness, and health, to be a part of “the system” that offers us security, safety, and stability in return. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to imagine some animals may have the same sensibility. 

All that being said, of course I don’t condone people or businesses that are cruel or disrespectful to the animals they rely on. When done properly, it is a mutually beneficial relationship.

">I understand that big nerves can be surgically sewn together

They really can't. Once nerves are severed -- *by ""nerve"" in this context I mean the nerve cell (the neuron itself)*. But the nerve *sheaths* (the nerve's cover) can be sewn back and *HOPEFULLY* the nerves regrow within the sheath restoring innervation.

The same is true with the ""really tiny nerves"" and requires the skill of a surgeon whose specialty is microsurgery which is basically reconnecting the severed nerve sheaths. As with their larger cousins, all you can do is HOPE that the nerve regrows within the sheath to its pre-damaged state. Many times they do not.",1

"I am a lawyer who specializes in criminal law. I am very liberal and I support the protests.

If I were arrested in these circumstances, I would not expect to be read a Miranda warning. I would know that the officers making the arrest would have no obligation to administer one to me.

The only time a suspect needs to be administered a Miranda warning is if they are going to be subject to a custodial interrogation.

The lawyer/protestor featured in the article seems to be concerned about the fact that the arresting officers and those who processed her never administered a Miranda warning to her. This is incorrect. They were not legally obligated to do so. 

The lawyer does say that some officers asked her about what happened and she (correctly) invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to speak with them. That is the only point at which the officers conceivably might have needed to Mirandize her, and then only if they hoped to use her response as evidence in court — which is unlikely, considering it doesn’t sound like they were recording the interaction.

The article raises serious points about what is happening in Portland and how shittily protestors are being treated. But the headline, about the lack of a Miranda warning, is a red herring.",1

Again.",1
"Q    President Trump, do you agree with Senate Republicans discussing the possibility of extending short-term unemployment insurance today so that they prevent benefits from expiring?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think a lot of politicians are discussing that — Republicans, Democrats.  And right now, a lot of my representatives are on the Hill.  They’re discussing CARES Act or phase four — whatever you want to call it.  And I think, ultimately, something good will come out of it.

The economy is starting to really come back strongly, when you look at the numbers — even with the fact that — like California is still closed up and many big states.  I think the numbers are even more impressive, considering that some states like California — big ones — are pretty well shut down.

So we expect to have something over a period of time — over the appropriate period of time.",1
"Q    Thank you, sir.  Thank you very much.  These two questions are with Andrew Feinberg and J.C. Bua.  One is: Today you said you’re sending federal law enforcement officers to run cities run by “extreme politicians” — that’s the word you used — which — who happen to be all Democrats who have supported Black Lives Matter protests.

THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t say I that.  I didn’t say who supported —

Q    Millions of Americans voted for these people —

THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I said Democrat politicians, and these are the cities where you have the problem.  If you look at Chicago, if you look at Detroit, if you look — I mean, look around any of these cities where we have the problems.

And we’re sending them help, but we’re really waiting for them to call for the big help, for the big numbers, for the large numbers of people that we have ready, willing, and able.

You look at Chicago, where 14 people were shot yesterday; where, over the weekend, many people died and many people were shot; and, over the last month, they’re setting record numbers.

We are waiting for the mayor, respectfully, and other mayors and governors to call us.  We are ready, willing, and able to go in there with great force.

Now, we also have people that are going in and arresting drug dealers, arresting some of the shooters that are doing the shooting.  We know who they are.  We’re working with police forces.  And even though, in some cases, they’re told, “Don’t work with the federal government,” the police forces have great respect for the federal government — what we do.

But we’re ready, willing, and able to go into these cities that are just being decimated with shooting.  And we’re going to help.",1
"Q    I have a question on crime.  But first, I don’t think we really got an explanation yesterday on why the health experts are no longer joining you at these briefings.  Can — can you explain why?

THE PRESIDENT:  Because they are briefing me.  I’m meeting them.  I just spoke to Dr. Fauci.  Dr. Birx is right outside.  And they giving me all of — everything they know, as of — as of this point in time.  And I’m giving the information to you, and I think it’s probably a very concise way of doing it.  It seems to be working out very well.

Q    Okay.  So, on crime —

THE PRESIDENT:  But they’re very much — they’re very much involved.  They’re very much — the relationships are all very good.  All very good.  The relationships that we have with the doctors, with everybody working on the virus has been, I think, extraordinary.

Kayleigh is here, and I think you would say the same thing.  You work with them all the time.

Yeah, go ahead.  Please.

Q    So, on crime: In 2016, you said it was President Obama’s fault that homicides were up in Chicago.  So why was it the President’s fault then, but it’s not your fault now?

THE PRESIDENT:  Chicago is a disaster.  The mayor is saying, “Don’t come in.”  The mayor is telling us not to come in.  At some point, we can void that if we have to, but we — and we may have to, at some — because it’s out of control.  I assume she’s saying that for political reasons.  I think it’s negative political reasons.

She’s a — she’s a Democrat.  I’m going to be nice.  She’s a Democrat.  She’s making a big mistake.  People are dying in Chicago and other cities, and we can solve the problem.  They have to ask us, but —

Q    Right, but —

THE PRESIDENT:  — we can solve the problem.

Q    — why was it President Obama’s fault in 2016?  You credited it as him being in office.

THE PRESIDENT:  Because President Obama was invited in, and he did a poor job.  President Obama could have gone into Chicago.  He could have solved the problem, and he didn’t.  In our case, they don’t want us in.  We can solve the problem very easily.  We’re equipped with the best equipment, the best people.

And you see what we’re doing.  I mean, Portland was coming down; it was busting at the seams.  And we went in and protected all the federal buildings.  Those federal buildings are totally protected.  But — and we had to do that.  And Portland is a very different place than Chicago.

But Chicago should be calling us — and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others — to go in and really help them.  Because when you’re losing many people a weekend — many, many people; you see the same numbers as I do — when you’re losing these people, they should call us, and they should say, “Come on in.”  And it’s incredible to me, but they’re not doing it.

At some point, they will.  At some point, we may have no other choice but to go in.",1
"Jeff, please.

Q    Mr. President, are you looking at closing further Chinese embassies in the United States?

And did you ask Ambassador Woody Johnson to bring the British Open to your Thurnberry — or Turnberry property in Scotland?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I never spoke to Woody Johnson about that, about Turnberry.  Turnberry is a highly respected course, as you know — one of the best in the world.

And I read — I read a story about it today.  And I had never — I never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that.  No.

As far as closing additional embassies, it’s always possible.  You see what’s going on.  We thought there was a fire in the one that we did close.  And everybody said, “There’s a fire.  There’s a fire.”  And I guess they were burning documents or burning papers, and I wonder what that’s all about.",1
"Okay, how about one or two more?  Please.

Q    Yes, thank you.  Would you like to respond to Joe Biden, who, today, described you — you might have heard that — as the first racist to be elected President.  Those are his — that was his words.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, it’s interesting because we did criminal justice reform.  We passed criminal justice reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do.  We did opportunity cities.  We did the greatest — if you look at what we’ve done with Opportunity Zones, nobody has ever even thought of a plan like that.

Prior to the China plague coming in, floating in, coming into our country, and really doing terrible things all over the world — doing terrible things — we had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American — almost every group was the best for unemployment.  The unemployment numbers were the best.

You look at — so you look at employment; you look at Opportunity Zones; and maybe most importantly of all, you look at criminal justice reform; you look at prison reform.  I’ve done things that nobody else — and I’ve said this, and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it: I’ve done more for black Americans than anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.  Nobody has even been close.

Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you.

"And we’re all in this together.  And as Americans, we’re going to get this complete.  We’re going to do it properly.  We’ve been doing it properly.  Sections of the country come up that we didn’t anticipate — for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera — but we’re working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it’s all going to work out, and it is working out.

So, with that, I’ll take a few questions, please.  Yeah, please.

Q    Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you a question about the surge of federal agents to various cities.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.

Q    The mayor of Chicago just said, moments ago, that you’re doing this to divert attention from your failures on coronavirus.  You are only targeting cities —

THE PRESIDENT:  But we haven’t had that failure.  And —

Q    You are only targeting cities, though, run by Democrats.  Is this just a political stunt?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, the cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by Democrats.  You have radical-left Democrats running cities like Chicago and so many others that we just had a news conference.  And, unfortunately, that’s the way it is.  I mean, that’s the facts.

When you look at Chicago and you look at the job — Mayor Lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday, and I think, in their own way, they want us to go in.  There’ll be a time when they’re going to want us to go in full blast, but right now we’re sending extra people to help.  We’re arresting a lot of people that have been very bad.

As far as the coronavirus, as you say, I think we’ve done some amazing things, and I think you’ll probably see that if you compare our statistics to other countries.  And if you look at death rates, et cetera, you’re going to see — and especially into the future, with what’s happening — you’re going to see some very, very impressive numbers for the United States.

Jon, please.

Q    Just to follow up on that, sir, real quick?",1
"THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead, Jon.

Q    Mr. President, do you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely?  And regarding the children in your family — your son, your grandchildren — are you comfortable — do you plan to have them back in person, in school this fall?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well, I am comfortable with that.  And we do have a national strategy, but, as you know, ultimately it’s up to the governors of the states.  I think most governors, many governors want these schools to open.  I would like to see the schools open, especially when you see statistics like this.  We have great statistics on — on young people and on safety.  So we would like to see schools open.  We want to see the economy open.

We just had a report, literally as I walked in, that we set an all-time record on housing price increases — up, I think they said, 21 percent, which is a record.  It’s never happened before.  That’s a great sign.

We have a — an economy that’s going to be booming.  It’s going to be — a lot of jobs are being produced.  The job numbers will be coming out shortly — meaning over the next week or so — and I think it’ll be a continuation of the last two months.  The last two months have been incredible.

So I think we’re going to have a great economy.  You’re going to have a fantastic next year.  I think you’re going to have a very good third quarter, actually, when the third quarter numbers come out.  Interestingly, they’ll be announced just before the election.  They’ll be announced around November 1st.

So, yeah, I would like to see the schools open — open 100 percent.  And we’ll do it safely; we’ll do it carefully.  But when you look at the statis- — the statistics I just read, having to do with children and — and safety, they’re very impressive.  They have very strong immune systems.

Q    But you would understand that the —

THE PRESIDENT:  Please.

Q    — the children who go to school then go back to home, they’re with — some live with their grandparents.

THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.

Q    That there’s — there’s a real risk.  Would you understand if some schools —

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, they do say that they don’t transmit very easily.  And a lot of people are saying they don’t transmit, and we’re looking at that.  We’re studying, Jon, very hard that particular subject: that they don’t bring it home with them.

Now, they don’t catch it easily; they don’t bring it home easily.  And if they do catch it, they get better fast.  We’re looking at that fact.  That is a factor, and we’re looking at that very strongly.  We’ll be reporting about that over the next week.",1
"Q    Mr. President, at least three governors today came out with new orders on mask requirements.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.

Q    Is that something you wish all the governors would do?  Is that something you would encourage?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, a lot of the governors, they have different requirements.  Some of the governors are very strong on masks; others aren’t.  I think it’s really going to ultimately be up to them.

We’ve given them the facts.  We’ve given them everything we know.  They have their own facts.  Some are strong on masks, and, as you know, some aren’t in the same ballpark.  But I think —

Q    Shouldn’t they all be?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think all are suggesting if you want to wear a mask, you wear it.  I bring one.  I have one.  I’ve worn it.  And I think when I’m in certain settings, like hospitals and various — or when I’m close — when, you know, when you can’t socially distance, I believe in it.  Let’s see: Do I?  I do.  I have it.

And if — if — you know, in certain — in certain instances, I think you really — I think you want to travel with a mask.  There are instances where you really can use it.  I would believe it would be a good thing.

Yeah, please.

Q    Sir, one, just, follow-up: D.C. Mayor Bowser came out with such an order today.  It, of course, doesn’t apply to federal properties, but would you encourage federal properties and — including the White House complex — to follow the order?  Or on military bases?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to — we’re going to make a decision over the next 24 hours.  We’ll let you know what that decision is.  Okay?",1

This was right after the field goal faux pas of the Jan 2007 NFC wild card game where Romo fumbled the snap that let the Sea Hawks sustain their lead and kicked the Cowboys out of Super Bowl contention. Romo, not yet a national celebrity, escaped to Beaver Creek to get away from Texas. We were out at a restaurant one night and he was wearing his Cowboys hat. A girl with a group of friends approached our table, a bit tipsy, and confronted Romo saying, you should be ashamed to wear that hat. Everyone at the table started looking around, getting a little uncomfortable, and watching to see how Tony would handle it. But it quickly became clear the girl was just a Cowboys fan that saw his hat and didn't recognize him. Suddenly the table started laughing and pointed out to her that he was Tony Romo. At first she was like, no he's not. But recognition finally dawned on her and she freaked out. Group pictures were taken. He was a good sport. It was pretty funny.",1

Why do so many Redditors care what mode other Redditors use?,1
I'm not 😎,1
I don’t trust people who use light mode.,1
"there's two ways of providing lighting for photography.

1. flash which is a quick burst of high powered light
2. continuous lighting which is basically a lamp pointed at the subject/model.  

there are pros and cons to both methods.  the flash method uses less power, doesn't cause your model to overheat/melt, and is portable and can be run off battery.  however, you don't get to see immediately what you exposure or shadows look like so it may take some experimentation every time something changes.",1
The camera shutter is only on for a brief period of time and therefore the longer sustained light would make no difference,1
"I am NOT a photography expert, but I do remember old cameras quite fondly.

TLDR: For a long time, it was simply easier to make cameras that could have a well-timed shutter/flash mechanism than it was to create longer-lasting flashes.

Older cameras (1970s and 1980s) used to use disposable flashes - you'd buy something that looked like [this](https://i.imgur.com/WoU68mW.jpg) which would have half a dozen flash bulbs on it. When you hit the trigger, the shutter would open and the camera would send a charge (from a capacitor) to the flash component. The flash component was essentially a lightbulb that was designed to burn out instantly - and in a bright and fantastic way (ever turn on the light and it flashes brightly before it burns out?).

Before this, people used to use a [pan of gun-powder](https://i.imgur.com/twW7TeH.jpg) (or other similar combustable elements) which would create a flash - this would need to be timed well against the camera's trigger also.

Timing things against the camera's trigger was simply a lot easier than creating a power and light source that could be sustained for 5+ seconds at a time.

So to answer the question, the ability to have sustained bright light is really a modern convenience that simply didn't exist (in a compact, easy to carry in your pocket way) until recently. The fact that camera phones use a 2-3 second flash now-a-days seems rather strange to most of us because we're used to what was just barely possible previously.

This is ALSO why in professional photography studios, they'll have big, fancy, and expensive lights that will stay on during the duration of a shoot. The camera itself won't always have its own flash because it's simply not necessary (and it also creates highly directional light).",1
"You only need light while the shutter is open.  It saves power to use as little light as possible.  If you use a low-light 5 second exposure, the subject and camera must be completely still of it will cause a blur.  Nobody wants a picture when you have to be super still for 5 seconds.  Quick snaps and action photos are only possible because of fast shutters.  fast shutters need bright flashes, and battery operation means those flashes need to be short.",1

"I had 2 super religious parents growing up which caused 2 very toxic experiences to occur. 1 was when my mom would ground me and take my phone and impersonate me and use it to text my friends while I was grounded. Don’t have to go into details there, that one is self explanatory.

The other one requires a long background but it’s worth it kinda: my parents were still able to pressure me into going to church for a while which is fine, I have nothing against church I just don’t wanna go with them or really go to that specific one. Well my mom would always try to force me to have friendships with the other people at church. A lot of times these friendships were highly inappropriate; either it was a weird age gap, or just obviously the other church kid was a total weirdo so of course I would just say what’s up bro or whatever and then that would be that. Well when I was about college age this really weird molester looking dude probably about 7 years older than me (I was like a 22 year old dude then) came into church. Some old lady had apparently saved him from the streets or something. My mom told me that he looked like a nice guy and I should at least talk to him and make him feel welcome in the church. I know it’s bad to judge people by their appearance, but I’m TELLING you, it’s not just the way he looked. It was his mannerisms too. He kept looking at young girls and boys really funny, looking at me, looking at my mom, even looking at random old people as if he wanted to have sex with them or something. Guy was obviously some kind of pedophile or sex offender or something. I tell my mom F no I’m not talking to that guy I don’t want any association with that person, just because they go to my church doesn’t mean I need to associate. Of course she pulls him over to where I was sitting in church and made me say hi to him. He said some really weird shit about how to kill an animal or something at one point. Okay now it gets to the internet part: that guy from church randomly added me on Facebook. I declined the request. Not sure if he made another account or if Facebook lets you request again but the same day I got a request again. Whatever, I accepted it. He messaged me and said hi. I ignored it for like over a day and said hi back. He tried to have a conversation with me, asked me in a really weird way how my day was, so I just completely ignored him. About 2 days later he said hi again. Ignored him. This kept repeating for a while. Finally he started having an entire conversation with just himself on my messages. He would say hey or good morning and I wouldn’t respond or even open it. 3 days into it he asked me when I’d be back at church. The next day he told me he really misses me and my brother. Like 8 hours later the same day he said he had always liked me. He asked me how the move into my new house was going. I had never told him I was moving into a new house. Still without me having said anything at this point he kept going. He asked me when I was gonna show him my dick. I didn’t respond. He asked me again within like an hour to send him a nude. (It doesn’t matter really but just to give full story I’m not gay). Finally after the 3rd or 4th time of him asking me for a nude I sent him 1 message “fuck off” and he responded by saying either way he was gonna jack off to my profile pic later. And right after that he said he was gonna imagine me naked the whole night. I messaged him and told him to stay the fuck away from me and I blocked him and haven’t went back to that church since then. He moved out of town supposedly but I’m still not going back. 

TLDR; mom forced me to introduce myself to a likely sex offender at church. He stalked me and solicited nudes on Facebook",1

"Oh this is dumb and probably doesn’t completely fit with the question but when I was younger, (probably around 13-14?) my mom always encouraged me to wear black clothing because I was heavier and it’s “supposed to make you look slimmer” (Great parenting) so that’s what I started doing. So much so that eventually everything in my closet was dark grays and blacks.

Well one Sunday, right as our family is about to leave for church....my dad stops me in my tracks and starts berating me for always wearing so much black. Accusing me of being a goth, accusing me of worshiping satan... and I just started laughing. I hadn’t ever tried to be a goth. I was trying to “look nice” in the only way I thought I could. Well he started accusing me of being evil and I just remember thinking “Yep, okay. I’ll be the bad guy.” This was many years ago. (Yes my childhood was a mess) it makes me laugh every time I think about it though. It’s literally the moment I crossed over to the dark side and never looked back.

"Investing in an index is like buying a team of 6 Pokemon. Each with different elemental types and specialties to help you weather what you might face.

Investing in a single stock is like having one Charizard. Having that one Charizard might help you whoop some ass on multiple occasions (I.e you might have some VERY good days on the market)  but because you’ve only got one type, you’ll get your ass kicked in just as many, if not more occasions. The balance of an index fund is seen as more beneficial and much safer in the long run.",1
"Whereas standard stock buying is picking a few select stocks you feel good about, index stocks just buys a little bit of all the top options.

There are various stock indexes, not index stocks, which are collections of stocks that somebody thought were a useful gauge of the stock market as a whole. So you hear the news saying, ""The Dow was up 200 points today because of [something]."" 

An index fund is a mutual fund that simply buys all the stocks in some index, trying to mirror its performance, rather than trusting the genius of some stock picker.
As such, its performance should be more ... average. 
And since *very* few stock pickers beat the average over several years, that's good enough.",1

To put this in another perspective, the u.s population has more small arms than the actual military. It is theoretically it's own standing army, and easily the most heavily armed, and densely armed, population in the world. And with the largest volunteer army in the world it also has one of the the largest population of veterans in the world. To put simply, law enforcement turning on the american people doesnt end well.

"If you have a budget, you don't require a trial period. Your budget would inform you of how much of a surplus you have or how much you can afford. With a budget you can also account for how much your payments will cost you in the future, which is especially useful if your salary does not keep up with inflation.

There's no harm in having a trial period that leads to saving money; however, you shouldn't need to use one if you are aware of your finances and managing them actively. I couldn't imagine always implementing a trial period, as this would have generated some missed opportunities for time-sensitive purchases/deals (i.e., house, vehicle, trailer).",1

4. Don't actively think either. You can't stop thoughts from entering your head, but don't *pursue* them. Just let them drift past. It's very similar to how you go about meditating, except the goal is to pass out instead of maintain a conscious disassociated state.",1

Friends can not be overrated. Always keep someone you trust near you. Dont make friends with people who only want their problems in your hands and wont help with yours. Become the friend you want. Dont stick around in toxic friendships. Once you find a good set of friends (could be just one) make sure you care for them and they care for you. Dont let your masculinity or femininity get in the way. Friends make life 100% better with the right ones. But you cant ask for what you dont give. Most people are toxic without even realizing it. Make sure you aren’t being selfish and help them out as much as they do.,1

"We had a teacher whose wife was 9 months pregnant.  This was back in the late 90s, so cell phones weren't really a thing yet.  Pagers were and everyone had one clipped to their belts.  The teacher had an emergency pager.  The baby pager.  If it goes off, you know shit is about to go down. 

We were gathered in groups for our class.  I think it was two or three desks pushed together.  One group called the teacher over so that they could ask him a question. 

While he was leaning over to look at the paper, another student reached around and set the pager off. 

The teacher jumped, started going in circles and looked like he had no clue what to do.  All of a sudden the kids in the group started laughing.  Once we all figured out what happened the whole class lost it.

The teacher realized it was a joke and calmed down pretty quick.  It was a nice test run for him, I suppose.  His wife went into labor a couple days later.",1

Now, the twist, the kid pulled the same prank the next day, hoping for the same reaction, which admittedly is stupid. When the black board slid open and the kid hopped out the teacher just calmly said ""Ryan, you're a loser, you're always going to be a loser, and later in life when you are reflecting on what a failure you are you can think back to this moment and hopefully hear me in your head saying I told you so."" and no one fucked with that teacher again.",1

That's really messed up.,1
"Scared. Because even if just a few officers directly connected to abuses, EVERY law enforcement officer across the country would somehow see it as an attack on them, and start treating people even worse",1
I would be very afraid of what the government would do to us in retaliation.,1
Horrified,1
That would be fucking horrible.,1
"I'm against all violence. So, that would be bad.",1
About as horrified as when they kill somebody in a George Floyd type scenario. I think less killing people is good for all concerned.,1
"I'm pretty sure that's actual terrorism. I wouldn't worry that the government would collapse since my government has the largest military in the world, but it would still be sad.",1
"If you replace Police with Politicians, I would be entertained!",1
I’d feel sad. Wtf ?,1
"I would be scared, because then the general public would be ok with the police adopting more extreme tactics in the face of a new threat to their lives.",1
"String of killings are awful. Seeing the rise in violence, crime, and murders across the country is deeply troubling. And it appears to just be at the tip.",1
"What the fuck kinda question is this? 

I'd feel fucking horrified.",1
"I would sit back and see how Americans kill each other and the ""big guys"" just laughing about how they found a nother idiot who takes the blame. But jokes aside people who kill any kind of law enforcement should be hunted. Those people get a shitty pay for risking their lives and having to put up with all this bs.",1
A solid iota more hopeless than I normally do about the future of this country,1
It's already happened. You just don't hear about it on the news.,1
"iPhones are expensive gear, overly expensive gear",1

A lot of people who do really cool shit are 'B grade' (that's not just a statistical thing). - My answer would be most aspects.",1
Asking pointless questions?,1
Probably your driver's test. You only need to pass—don't stress about getting that A. Admit you aren't perfect and go for a B; you're more likely to pass.,1
Take the fuse out of the plug and tell them theirs something in place so you can only do it during certain times. Make up some fancy stuff so they don't question it and if they try they'll see it doesn't work. Just put the fuse back in during off peak times. 😂 eventually they'll start doing it and you won't need to keep taking the fuse out 😂,1
"If your washer runs on a standard 120V line, you could put a Christmas light timer on it, so they can only start a wash cycle during the off hours. But talk to them before you do that, otherwise you’ll be circumvented immediately. 

But your increased electrical bill is probably not from laundry; it’s more likely from AC, lights, and other moderately energy-using activities that don’t normally happen during peak hours....but we’re all stuck at home.",1
Get a industrial safety lockout device and lock the plug or the circuit breaker out during peak hours,1
"No.  Plus this is how you get your @ss kicked.  You are not their mother.  Leave them alone.  Soon you will be gone, and none of this will be your problem anymore.

Source:  my roommates were waaaay worse than yours.....",1
"Wd40 isn't a lubricant, dumbass.",1
"I'm going to guess that it's related to lower temperatures at higher elevation. The amount of moisture air can hold before it becomes saturated is proportional to it's temperature (i.e. hotter air can hold more moisture than colder air). Temperature decreases with elevation so the air up there becomes saturated more quickly. Not an expert, pulling from a weather class I took in college 15 years ago.",1
"If all other things are equal, air at higher elevations is usually colder, and in particular, air that *moves* to higher elevations from low elevations *becomes* colder as it moves because it is under less pressure and expands. The temperature of the air where the storm forms is colder, and therefore more likely to be below the dewpoint.",1
"Doubles the known timeline for North American human populations, from 15,000 to 30,000 years!",1
"> It is also a mystery as to ""why no archaeological site of equivalent age to Chiquihuite Cave has been recognised in the continental United States,"" said Gruhn.

Humans reached Australia when, 45+ 000 years ago?  There must have been some capacity to use rafts or boats.",1
Okay but when did tapirs arrive in the Americas?,1
I always knew humans came from caves,1
"Mainstream archeologists are stupidly stubborn on Clovis-first model. Any respectable archeologist should know it was the wrong theory. But nontheless this is a great and undisputable discovery, another big slap in the face for those unwilling to accept new evidence.",1
"I dont know, the Bible pretty put out the definitive statement on when humanity was started...anything outside of that, is just more guessing...lol

"Any person with the desire to lead, should not be trusted to do so.",1
It really depends on countries. But just messy as a whole.,1
there are no honest politicians,1
Way more complicated than I or anyone else can possibly understand but somehow everyone thinks it’s run by stupidity,1
"Very complicated and needed to be handled with care. Quite interesting and very important

Politicians? Arguably some of the worst people on earth. ALL countries have shitty politicians. They are corrupt and only care about themselves and will stand against what is right (both factually and morally) in favour of their pre determined side of right or left wing. They play with nation's and will bankrupt millions for person and political gain. I feel very strongly about this",1
"I'd say at least in the u.s. 90% power hungry corrupt scum that will say/do anything to ""move up"" the rest maybe want to actually help people",1
"I do not trust any politician. When I argue against Trump, people say, “what about Obama?” but I never supported Obama. When I criticized Obama, I got called a Republican even though I am actually way too far leftist for that. I just dont really respect politicians and think our job is to challenge them all.",1
Less  for either to occupy my mental space the better. Basically a bad melodrama,1
men are bad leaders. they just want power most of the time. i'm not saying everyone is like that but most of them are,1
politics is mostly made up of egotistical people who divide others and put others down for having a different opinion,1

It’s called late stage capitalism,1
"> As the world expects more of corporations, it is untenable to support social and environmental causes while giving money, even indirectly, to candidates who oppose them.

> An examination of political spending over the past decade shows how those companies — and dozens of other Fortune 500 corporations — quietly funded political efforts that are antithetical to their public stances. They financed state attorneys general seeking to undo the Affordable Care Act, which has provided health insurance for millions of Americans during the pandemic; they provided funds that backed local legislators who tried to roll back L.G.B.T.Q. rights; and they gave money that supported candidates challenging federal climate change initiatives.",1
"It's almost as if politicians and corporations in their positions of power and authority don't actually give a rats ass about what they say publicly. It's almost as if they cower to the loudest crowd at the moment and hold that face long enough to wait until the vocal minority move on to the next social warrior outage so that they can then continue pandering to those groups, while simultaneously doing everything in their power to hold onto their money and to accumulate more power. Imagine that!  People are power hungry and money hungry greedy assholes on every level and don't really care about social justice or any other type of social warrior pandering but give great lip service so that the public doesn't boycott them and close them down.

"it wasn't really on life but on people when i was 6 because people didn't like me the way that i was. and now i'm a: feminist, a person with anger issues and loves animals more than humans.",1
"I think it varies. It all depends the stage you find yourself. 

When you live with your parents, you hear that opinion all the time and end up getting some of their ideas in your head as your own, but there is so much about life you don’t yet know. 

Then everything changes after you leave the nest, you learn that things are mot what your parents told you and they will probably end up bailing you out a few times.

Next stage is becoming financially independent. When it comes a time that you no longer need help from anyone for anything and you make enough money to buy quality food, you will see a shift in your views as well. 

After that is the acceptance of getting old, that your body can no longer perform like it did. That in itself will change your vision on so much. 

I think the last stage is just knowing that death is approaching, either through seeing someone that you grew up with dying or a close friend, etc.

"When I was around 9 years old and couldnt swim. Me and my older sister (16) went to the local swimming pool. I was desperate to go down the biggest water slide but was frightened because I couldn't yet swim. My sister, who was a great swimmer, said she'd be at the bottom to catch me. I eagerly climbed the stairs leading to the top. I flung myself down the slide, and rocketed into the water. To find myself quickly struggling to stay afloat. I tried my absolute best to keep my head above water but after what seemed like an eternity. Everything went black. When I properly came to, I was in a room in the swimming facility. With a paramedic and a lifeguard standing there. It turned out my sister had been busy flirting with a lifeguard and forgot to stand at the bottom and catch me. I was in the water for about 3-4 minutes. I'm not really sure how close I was to drowning, but it was a terrifying experience. I can now swim pretty well and it didn't leave any long lasting fear of the water. But it was the closest I came to death.",1
"I probably almost died in a potential car wreck.  My sister and I were driving down an intercity highway.  Essentially a two lane road, one for each direction, in the middle of nowhere.  So to pass a car you had to play leap frog with oncoming traffic.

This truck behind us was aggressively passing people, utterly fearless.  Until he got caught in the opposite lane because the line ahead was too long.  No room to get over.  He's almost right next to us and we're all going around 70 mph.  A car was coming ahead and just narrowly missed the truck by swerving off the road barely in time.  We saw it coming and actually jumped when it happened expecting the worst.  If those two collided head on it would have destroyed everyone nearby, likely including us.  So that was fun.",1
"I was in a car wreck last year, we hit black ice and one side of the road is a canyon wall and the other side is the river. We rolled and landed right side up on a sandbar in a shallow spot, deepest spot was just under my knees. People have died hitting black ice on that road, so I consider it pretty lucky. Especially because neither of us were injured. There were tire chains in the foot well of the passenger side and when we stopped they were around the steering wheel. Needless to say, the next work vehicle we got (because it was a work vehicle and it was totalled) I insisted no loose tire chains.",1

"In medicine, they say (somewhat darkly) that all bleeding stops eventually. When you get sufficiently small (or no) blood flow to the major organs, they cease to function and no amount of subsequent blood flow will get them to work again. The big two organs are the brain and heart. So, the faster you lose blood, the faster you will reach a point where there is insufficient blood flow to those (and other) organs and you die... you cease to be... you've gone to meet your maker.",1
"The body requires a certain amount of blood to flow round the body carrying oxygen to vital parts no oxygen the organs die, vital organs die the whole body dies. If you lose too much blood through a wound and that blood isn't replaced via a transfusion you will die. Alternatively if a vital organ is struck you will die and again bacteria in the wounds can produce huge amounts of toxins which can kill the body basically poisoning it.",1
"The common definition of death today it no brain activity. I can happen because of the cells do not get what they need to survive that in the short term is oxygen or direct physical damage to the brain cells themselves.

So you die because blood with oxygen no longer reaches the brain because of bleeding, direct damage to the heart, blood, other liquid that blocks the airflow to the lungs, hole ins the lungs so they do not inflate when you breathe in.

The other is direct damage to the brain so if the bullet hit the head and physically tear apart the brain, but shockwave from a hit can alose damage the brain that perhaps result in blood vessels that burst in the brain or swelling.  


There are other possibilities like the bullies do damage in some way so you fall and hit your head or other parts if you fall over an edge.

Then there is long thems effect where the bullet or knife can cause infection, you could damage some internal organs that result in death that is not immediate.

The most likely are bleeding and loss of blood or direct damage to the brain.

There is likely more way that you can die from a knife or bullet.",1

Sure, but that was back in 94 when Clinton, Sanders, and Biden all passed and signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement act into legislation.  Judge someone on their actions over words.

I put my hand up and once I was acknowledged, I asked ""But couldn't bird's who eat fish have flown up there and dropped them on the way to their nests?"". The instructor looked at the other two instructors and said I shouldn't ask such silly questions. About 15 minutes later, the other kids were given chocolate cake. I was not.",1

Many people (including me) agree with the words “Black Lives Matter”, as well as the implied need for police reform, but are strongly against the organization called Black Lives Matter.

China violates international law every day.,1
Yeah nah get fuck China.,1
As if China cares about following international law. They can get fucked,1
to me this is proof that china wants to punish the citizens of hong kong for having the audacity to think they were special. it is the ideology of western democracy that thrived under two systems one country that china wishes to eradicate because it makes people believe that they have a right to be heard. china understood that hong kong would become a financial ghost town if they went through with passing their law--and they did it anyway because authority is more important to them than money. i think china will make an example of hong kong citizens by forcing them to stay in hong kong as they watch its prosperity dry up. they will suffer because china wants to extinguish any flame of independence their decades of semiautonomy may have lit in them,1

" 

It was Saturday morning. I vividly remember that the day was foggy because of rainy season. By that morning, after I had given a hay to our cattles I went to a nearby mountain to my thiny village. I used to go to this mountain. This mountain is covered with different types of plants. No single plant stand alone, they are interlocked because the plant coverage is dense. Sittings Inside this mountain I used to read books and write something that astonished me around. That morning I was doing my grade 5 mathematics homework inside the mountain. Suddenly I saw some one flying in the sky. I couldn't believe my eyes. I checked myself if I was dreaming. I stood up and gazed over that flying body. The only flying entity that I heard about is angel. But the shape of the body flying in the sky was completely different from the angels those are drawn on our church walls. I said to myself who can believe me if I say I saw somebody flying in the sky? I searched for someone around. I found no body for it was too early of the morning and very cold weather most of my friends didn't wakeup. While astonishing, I saw that body landing around the lower edge of the mountain. To be honest firstly I feared to approach to the landed body. I looked it out in short distance. I became sure that it was an angel with different form of wing from what I saw in picture in our church because the man I saw was very white and for angels in our community believed that they are white in colors. I made the sign of the cross and approached him. The first word he said extending his hand for greeting was ""hello do you speak English?"". For I could speak a little bit I said him yes. ""Good, how are you "" he said. I am fine thank you and you?. ""Good "" he said. I wanted to say him ""are you angel came from heaven?"" But I didn't know what It was called an angel in English. I asked him something that approach in meaning to what I wanted to say. ""You came down from God?"" He laughed and said too much. While he was talking to me I heared not all but partially because his pronunciation was difficult. Even he didn't say words that I know as my teacher says them. He asked me my education level, the direction of our village, how much we are far from the high way and why I was there early in the mountain. I told him everything with my broken English. Finally he gave me two dollars and asked me to escorte him to a place where there is a highway because we live 30 kilometers away from such facilities. I escorted him to the nearby highway and came back to my home. Until I had taken my grade nine physics course about dynamics and kinematics I didn't know what was that flying body. That was a parashoot. In this way my life has two chapters.",1

"Well, a friend of mine I once knew at school was with this asshole jockey. The thing is she begged me not to tell anyone because if anyone found out, he said he'd kill her. I being the dumbass I was, did nothing but let it happen and be her crying pillow. This persisted for 2 years and I don't know how long this persisted before. I had enough when she came to me with bruises all over her chest and stomach. I had no clue what her parents were doing or if they cared to figure it out if they didn't know. I eventually decided to get revenge for her. I basically crashed his reputation with a rumor war until the faculty caught wind, which got them to interview her. Not only that, but this asshole managed to get her pregnant which allowed for him to get arrested and charged but CPS got involved and she was taken away on the premise of child neglect.

">The bill would remove the bust of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney from the Old Supreme Court Chamber, in the Capitol. Taney authored the Dred Scott decision in 1857, which declared African Americans couldn’t be citizens and was later widely panned. The Taney bust would be replaced with a statue of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice.

Can we also pull Taney's corpse out of the grave and slap it up a bit?",1

"Not me but my dad. He was hunting and shot a squirrel. He thought it was dead. Drove it 20 miles home and was going to skin it in the garage. He walked away from the table it was on to open the garage door. It's automatic but the motor wasn't designed to lift a door that heavy so he had to open it by hand. He goes outside and gets the door half open.... Then the world's most vengeful squirrel pulls a 1000 IQ move. It limps across the table, stepping on the door remote. This caused the door to slam down. One of the ""joints"" of the door sliced off a chick on one finger and the door landed on his foot.
He had to have surgery on both and his right hand index finger will never grow a fingernail again.

So they let it out the cage, and we both start playing with the dog. Well, things got a little crazy and he bit a chunk out of my brother's leg and scratched me up pretty good.

"I agree to an extent. I mean, if you are truly undecided, I think they should declare ""undecided"" but take classes with the best professors. There are definitely a lot of people in our physics department who love physics but have to teach themselves bc the professors are usually engrossed in their research. We recently had department drama and cuts within the aerospace department. So everyone's favorite professors got fired and even tho they were on that major, it was hard to learn with all the professors being let go",1
"Terrible advice. Dont go to school until you know what major or degree you want. If you have no idea the job or jobs you want to pursue, why would you go to school? Education is a vehicle that opens up opportunities for you. Why would you get in the vehicle and start driving without knowing the destination?

It'll cost you less time and money if you have some strategy and direction - not to mention motivation - than if you figure it out as you go along and hope for the best. Do some career planning, that is research and talk to people, and figure out where you want to go before you make an educational commitment. You can always add education. You can't get your money and life back.",1

"Mind to explain how? It stated on the first line it is developed by the US from the link.

>SKYNET is a program by the U.S. National Security Agency that performs machine learning analysis on communications data to extract information about possible terror suspects. The tool is used to identify targets, such as al-Qaeda couriers, who move between GSM cellular networks. Specifically, mobile usage patterns such as swapping SIM cards within phones that have the same ESN, MEID or IMEI number are deemed indicative of covert activities.[1][2] Like many other security programs, the SKYNET program uses graphs that consist of a set of nodes and edges to visually represent social networks.[3] The tool also uses classification techniques like random forest analysis. Because the data set includes a very large proportion of true negatives and a small training set, there is a risk of overfitting.[1] Bruce Schneier argues that a false positive rate of 0.008% would be low for commercial applications where ""if Google makes a mistake, people see an ad for a car they don't want to buy"" but ""if the government makes a mistake, they kill innocents.""[1]",1

"Of course protests caused a nonzero number of additional infections. But so far, evidence suggests that contribution is rather small. Areas with large numbers of protestors, like NYC and DC, saw cases continue to fall after the protests started. This is probably due to two factors. 

First, it seems that indoor transmission is much more common, where people are stuck breathing each other's air for extended periods. 

Second, and probably more importantly, the number of people protesting is a drop in the bucket compared to the working population at large. Of course the number of transmissions is primarily going to be driven by a local area's reopening and precaution schedule more, seeing as that effects orders of magnitude more people (compared to protests).",1

So if it’s a dream where something goes wrong for me I’m actually really worried when I wake up and it takes me a few moment to realize I was only dreaming. At times I actually get “control” of the dream and its just like I’m playing out a scenario in my head but I’m asleep. Usually that happens when I’m close to waking up, or at least it seems like I wake up shortly after because I feel half asleep when it’s happening. It’s kinda hard to describe.",1

"No, that's not how it works.

If the price is $100CAD, the price is $75USD.  If you try to give a store $75CAD for the $75USD item, they will say ""We don't take CAD"".  You will go to the bank and ask for USD, which the store will take, but you'll have to give the bank $100CAD to get $75USD.",1
"No. Currency is just a convenient way to measure value of goods and services.

If $75 USD = $100 CAD = $104 AU, then your purchasing power in those countries for those equivalent amounts of currency should yield the same goods/services.

In other words... if you want to buy a widget, that widget will cost $75 USD in the US, $100 CAD in Canada, and $104 AU in Australia.",1
"Think of it a bit like measuring in inches vs centimeters. In either case the length you're measuring is the same, but the number you use to describe it changes (i.e., you're dividing it into a different number of increments). With money, the value of the item remains the same but you're either dividing its value into 75 increments or 100 somewhat smaller increments.",1
"The exchange rate is less important than *changes* in the exchange rate.

Suppose you find an item for sale that costs 75 USD.  Based on the current exchange rate of 1.33 CAD per USD, you could buy it for 100 CAD.  But you decide to wait a few weeks.  The Canadian dollar weakens relative to the U.S. dollar, increasing the exchange rate to 1.50 CAD per USD.  Now, if you wanted to buy the same 75 USD item, you would have to pay 112.5 CAD.

You'd be buying the same item, but it's more expensive in CAD now relative to a few weeks ago.",1
"That’s not how it works, it’s like a unit of measure, say 40 inches and 100cm

It’s the same length (within rounding error) just with two different units, while it’s true that 1 inch is longer than 2 cm, it’s not like it’s better to buy 100 cm because it’s a large number, it’s the same length 

Swap the cm and inches with currencies and the  thing is the same

If I buy something for 75 USD or 100 CAD or 104 AUD, it’s the same thing, same amount of money, different numbers, but the value of the item is the same, the difference is everyone calls them all dollars, but it’s not the same thing, it’s just like Koronas or Euros",1

SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!,1
"I am a very quiet and reserved person in every day life now, and I rarely expression any level of emotion, because as my dad taught me ""only queers express themselves.""",1
"It was a yelling household because of me. Now that I'm an adult, half of me sees the toxic consequences of that sort of temperament, and I am genuinely working to improve. On the other hand, I'm wondering just how much of an issue it was for me to have tantrums, if every actual thing that I said during those tantrums was true.",1
Reading literature on Zen Buddhism helped me,1
"It was more of a yelling / hitting household but whatever.

I make a point of not yelling at or striking anyone. If I’m really angry, my hands go behind my back, my speech patterns and mannerisms go more formal and I speak quieter.

I keep in mind my own defensive reaction to someone yelling and punching (etc) and recognize that others are going to do the same. When we yell in anger at someone they’ll instinctively stop listening to the message and go on the defensive, but if you speak quieter with a calm demeanour they’re forced to strain to hear what you’re saying and will naturally try harder to hear what you have to say.

Also, I tend to instantly lose all respect for any adult throwing a temper tantrum because things didn’t go their way or they didn’t get the answer they were hoping for. I’ve got 19 years in the military and have never had to raise my voice (outside of safety related situations), I’ve found that a raised eyebrow followed by “are you done? Are you ready to talk like an adult?” is often enough to stall a tantrum.",1
"I snap at my wife sometimes when I get frustrated. It makes me feel horrible every time I do it but it’s all I saw growing up with my parents.

Ot brought of emotional instability and making me want to hide everything from my parents. I feel guilty about everything even if it’s not under my control,1
My mother is partially deaf and my dads hearing ain't too great either. So the yelling is just kinda so they can hear.,1
"I have limited memory of my childhood due to trauma associated with this. My brother (10+ years older) would frequently babysit my sister (4 years older, moderately intellectually disabled) and I for 8+ hours while my parents were away. He didn't like himself or his life, so during these periods he would get in our faces and scream as loud as he could for as long as he could. It was his therapy to yell at me for many years. I was 5-10 years old.

Oftentimes my parents would come back from wherever they went, unhappy with their marriage, and yelling at each other once they opened the front door. It only took a few minutes for their rage to shift to us. The year my family realized my sister was cognitively impaired, their anger developed a special strain of white middle-class entitlement and they shifted their yelling to me alone. ""I could handle it better than her"".  I was 11.

I remember waking up on a calm Sunday morning, getting ready for church as a family. The Sunday newspaper wasn't delivered and my dad threw a tantrum. He didn't want to go to church anyways, and now he didn't get to read the paper! My mother didn't give him the time of day. She wanted to have a spiritual, serene Sunday morning service. My father kept pecking until she lost her temper, and they started a yelling match 10 minutes before we had to leave for Church.  My father took a separate car. My mom drove my sister and I to church, yelling ""to herself"" the whole way.

When we got out of the car my father was waiting, smiling. We walked into the chapel with smooth strides and silky faces. Nothing could have possibly been bothering this family.

Nowadays I tend to be exceptionally quiet. Slow to anger, but maybe a little quick to judge. I am hyper-stimulated by sound. I become overwhelmed by the need to know what is happening around me at loud venues or restaurants. I typically eat with my back to a wall and my eyes on the door. My therapist says I am ""On Alert"".

I have many, many emotional issues to resolve before I feel like I can be emotionally responsible around other people / romantic partners. I feel a need to put in significant work on my insecurities, anxieties, and self-awareness before I start living my life in earnest. I am 29.

In a positive way, this has allowed me to develop a special awareness for those around me whose voices are not heard. I am passionate about simple things like maintaining eye contact with a storyteller who lost most of their audience partway through due to something outside of their control. Or a friend in my friend group who, for some reason, is constantly talked over.

Weirdly, I am ""lyrics blind"". I can't understand 99% of the lyrics in music. I only listen to music for the, well, music. I played in a Jazz group for a long time, and it was cathartic.

Similarly, I really struggle to learn new languages. As in, I've put in significant effort without any progress. It is a bit disheartening considering my supposed intelligence.

I mentioned both these things to a therapist and they said I could be hyper-sensitive to tones. I focus on tone to the exclusion of all else. When my family yelled at me, nothing that they said actually mattered. It was how they said it. A subtle shift in tone meant that something different or worse was about to come. By monitoring tones, I could anticipate how and when to put up my defenses.

I'm sure there's more but I'm still a work in progress and I've yet to figure it all out.",1
"I can't help but jump or twitch at loud banging. Or honestly, general loud, unexpected noises. Even when I'm aware its just loud laughing I'm internally a little stressed.

Being around people with houses that always have noise help, and loud videogames. Can't get over having light footsteps though.",1
"I am still a teenager, so I always go upstairs as soon as I finish my food. We only eat together if we're out (and even then, don't really talk), so as soon as I have finished eating, I go upstairs into my room where it's peaceful and quiet with my plants (I want more plants lol).",1

"Original intentions don't matter anymore

But if you had half a brain, you'd know that the original intent of BLM organization was to do exactly this. They're a political party, and they are dumping hundreds of millions into political campaigns and causes. If Biden gets elected, they'll continue using the Democrat party as a vector for their agenda

Then within the next 4/8 years they will begin to run BLM Party politicians in local/state elections to gain more power in those areas. Inevitably they will win some. In either 2024 or 2028, BLM will announce a presidential candidate

Just wait. If the Democrats keep pandering to BLM and nobody stands against BLM, they will gain power, and their agenda will continue being pushed onto this country

The thing is, almost nobody in this country thinks black lives don't matter, but the left is trying to paint all people who stand in the way of their crazy agenda as racist",1

I see a lot of the same, but less hate, from both sides and a lot less talking.",1
"From a domestic perspective, that depends largely on the outcome of the election.

A slim Biden victory (279EV - retaking Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin) would also likely deny Democrats the Senate. So, we can look forward to a minimum of four years of gridlock as the GOP, House, and President wouldn't be on the same page. Also a possible constitutional crisis in the event that one or more SCOTUS justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Thomas are all 70+) dies or retires and the Senate refuses to hold confirmation hearings.

A significant Biden victory (343EV - adding Arizona, Florida, Ohio, and Iowa) would probably be enough to give Democrats a bare Senate majority (taking seats in Arizona, Maine, Colorado and Iowa, and only losing Alabama). The GOP would likely still engage in significant obstruction, but Democrats could probably adjust the rules of the Senate (limiting the filibuster) to allow for legislation to pass.

An overwhelming Biden victory (412EV - adding Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina) would be a wholesale rebuke of the GOP, and almost assure the Democrats 55+ senators. I would imagine that the GOP would continue to be obstructionist, but Democrats could neuter them through rules changes such as limiting or removing the filibuster. Biden would likely appoint at least two SCOTUS justices during his first term (Breyer and Ginsburg) with the possibility of up to four more (Alito and Thomas due to age or illness, Roberts due to health, and Kavanaugh due to perjury during his confirmation hearings).

Internationally, I'd expect the US to reforge ties with Europe, specifically the UK, France, and Germany; likely rejoining agreements and international organizations such as the Paris Climate Accords, Trans-Pacific Partnership, and WHO; significant sanctions on Russia, Iran, and China; and a near complete reversal of actions regarding North Korea, with direct communication between Washington and Pyongyang cut off.

I think there has been long-term damage done to these relationships that will take time to repair. Former allies will likely look at the US with more skepticism than they have in the past, given the wild swings in policy coming from Washington, and the possibility that four years later they could potentially expect more of the same.

In general, however, I think the biggest change would be a palpable sense of relief that Trump isn't in charge anymore, and that Biden is a known quantity and rational actor.",1

> A committee that advises the health ministry on outbreak containment measures said in a letter to the country&#039;s top election official that holding the elections as scheduled would not be advisable because of the rapid spread of the virus.

"You should try asking this in a depression sub, and not to a bunch of people that think being sad for a few days makes them depressed.

Out of all the comments, the only good one was ""look at memes"".

Honestly though, this is a solo battle my friend. I am sure you have friends that care about you and support you. Most of them won't know how you are really feeling, or even understand. They think they do, because ""everybody get sad"". Bunch of ignorant people.

This is a daily struggle. Some days are better than others.

Start small. Exercise is an excellent way to improve you mood. But you don't feel like doing anything. Or a big workout. Right?
So, make yourself get up every morning for a week, and do 1 pushup. That's it.
Next week, 2pushups a day. That's it.
Continue to add pushups until you reach your personal goal.
Keep doing your personal goal every day.
Once you reach a goal. Add a new one. 

This doesn't HAVE to be exercise, but it is proven to improve your mood.

Maybe you have something you wanted to learn.
Spend 15mins learning it a day. 

If you haven't noticed. The main goal is to focus on something else.

On top of this advice, I would add that if you are having a lot of negative thoughts, and you catch yourself doing it, start actively thinking about something you enjoy, instead.

A lot of dealing with depression is actually dealing with your thoughts.

If you don't already, start setting days that you do certain things.  For example, I do my laundry every Saturday morning.

Theon Greyjoy. He was the only character that Tweedle D and Tweedle Dumbass didnt ruin in Season 8, and he was the only character death in the entire show that made me cry. The scene at the beginning of 8x04 where they have a funeral for everyone who died in 8x03 had me balling my eyes out but only because of Theon, and movies and shows don't usually make me cry. I remember back in Season 2 how I hated Theon and I wanted Robb Stark to behead him, but then he became my favorite character.

I actually really love the semi-hot take but also really understandable comparison of Siakam to Melo at that time,1
Melo was a much better offensive player than Siakam,1

The Chauncey/Lowry  similarities are super hard to ignore",1
Melo is far superior to Siakam,1
That 09 WCF was closer than people remember it’s just that Kobe had one of the best series of his career. That was a really good nuggets team.,1
"Enjoy the thought, but have a couple disagreements. 

Melo in 09 was much better than siakim is right now. 

Nene was MUCH better than jaxson hayes is. Harrell is an apt comparison. 

Taj is much better than balkan ever was. 

The rest are decent comps.",1

G Thang changed the world. 1st “Gangsta” Rap song to dominate the radio. Shifted the culture,1
Party Up is *THE* universal party anthem,1
"I honestly think it’s a draw, 10-10. I had it 9-9 goin into the last two rounds. G Thang over RR Anthem (though that could be a draw) and Party Up over Drop It Like It’s Hot. The real winners though were whoever watched and went on the wild nostalgia trip.",1
We don't deserve this level of greatness,1
This is the best thing I've ever seen. Greatness! Good to see DMX looking healthy. Snoop is a vibe,1

This is better than i expected it to be. DMX isnt doing great in the performance department but his catalog is holding up better than i thought it would against snoop,1
"Man, this is a real heavyweight fight I feel like every counter's a good one",1

"Cursed something that appears to have been cursed or something that should have never existed

"Is this from a meme language perspectyor an English as a second language perspective?

In the literal sense, ""cursed"", as a literal word,

>When you curse, you say words you wouldn't want your mother or your priest to hear you saying. A curse can also be wishing something awful on someone, like the witch who puts a curse on Sleeping Beauty. When you hear ""maledizione!"" in an Italian opera, somebody's having a curse placed on them.

As a meme, an image is *cursed* if it instill feelings of resentment, or irritation in the viewer.

*Blursed*, similarly, instills the same feelings, but in a way that the viewer might approve of, or in a way that provides a humorful irony.",1

"I found getting a sound system with a dedicated center channel speaker that can be adjusted (for mine in the settings of the receiver) really helped me. Most voices will then go through the center channel and you can adjust it up until you can hear the voices over the music. It is not perfect, sometimes it is just hard to understand the voices even for people without hearing problems, and that is just bad sound design on the shows part.",1
